/**
 * @file annotation-tool.js
 * @description Annotations controller (V1A callouts, V1B.1 directional arrows, V1B.2 freehand drawings): the
 *   Annotations panel, callout, arrow and drawing creation and editing, and the on-screen markers, labels, cards,
 *   arrows and strokes. THREE and DOM
 *   concerns live here; the data model, validation and
 *   anchor resolution live in core/annotations.js (on the Measurement anchor model), picking is the shared
 *   editor/surface-picker.js, the screen-space layout is core/annotation-layout.js, and persistence is
 *   PackLibrary. An annotation is informational: it never moves cargo, never takes part in collision,
 *   handling rules, assessment, AutoPack or any export, and moving a card never moves its anchor.
 *
 *   Ownership rules (see the V1A contract):
 *   - Markers and cards are a DOM/SVG layer above the canvas, so no canvas capture (Screenshot, PDF views,
 *     thumbnails, previews) can include them. Three.js stays authoritative for the camera and for where
 *     cargo is; the layer only projects what the scene displays.
 *   - Only one scene tool owns pointer input. While the Callout or Arrow tool (or a re-attach) is armed the
 *     Editor's pointer handlers delegate here instead of selecting or dragging cargo; OrbitControls is
 *     untouched, so orbit, pan and zoom stay available. The Measurement Tool and Annotations are mutually
 *     exclusive (the Editor wires that). Markers and cards are ordinary DOM, so clicking them never reaches
 *     the canvas.
 *   - Selecting an annotation clears the cargo selection and selecting cargo clears the annotation, so
 *     Delete acts on the annotation only when it owns the selection and never deletes cargo as a side
 *     effect. Ctrl/Cmd+Z stays cargo history; only an unfinished marker or card drag is cancelled by it.
 *     Deleting a callout offers a one-level Undo button in the panel, independent of cargo history.
 *   - One Escape closes one owner, in this order: a modal, dropdown, text field or popover that owns it
 *     (they keep it), the presentation view, an unfinished drag, the editor card, a pending re-attach, a
 *     pending arrow tail, the armed tool, the annotation selection. Anything else is left to the existing
 *     handlers (cargo deselection, drawers).
 *   - An arrow is two surface anchors drawn as an SVG shaft and head in this same layer (never a Three.js
 *     object, so no capture can include it). It is drawn only while both ends resolve and it is long enough
 *     to read; its ends move only by the owner's grip drag or Re-attach. Placing one takes two clicks (tail,
 *     then head): the first click is an unsaved gesture that Escape, closing the panel, Show Off, an
 *     operation, Measurement Mode, a Load Plan change or a cargo pose change all drop without writing.
 *   - A freehand drawing is one polyline on one flat face or convex patch, stored as one record and drawn as SVG paths in this
 *     layer. While the Draw tool is armed in Draw mode a primary drag draws instead of orbiting: this tool turns OrbitControls'
 *     rotation off (only that property, and restores exactly what it found), and Move View gives the camera back. Shift/Ctrl/Cmd +
 *     drag, the wheel, the other mouse buttons and two-finger touch keep navigating. A stroke is an unsaved gesture owned by the one
 *     pointer that began it: it freezes at the surface's edge, behind an occluder, at the view's edge or across a gap and never
 *     resumes, and Escape, pointercancel, a second touch, a blur, a hidden page, a tool or mode switch, an operation, Measurement
 *     Mode, a Load Plan change, a cargo change or a provisional pose all drop it without writing. Releasing it writes at most one
 *     record through PackLibrary.addDraw, which owns every rule about the stroke itself (simplification, limits, placement).
 *   - Creating, editing, moving, hiding and deleting are disabled while AutoPack, Unpack, Truck Change, a
 *     Truck Change preview or a transient AutoPack preview is active, and the message names the cause; the
 *     graphics are hidden for the same reasons. The committed scene is the authority, so an open, minimized or
 *     closed AutoPack Results card over the committed layout never pauses anything: annotations stay visible
 *     and editable. Results is only a placement obstacle: cards, labels and the editor keep clear of it, and
 *     Annotations never open, close, minimize, apply or change it.
 *     Viewing and selecting stay available. A background thumbnail capture is a pixel readback, not an
 *     edit: it never blocks annotations or cancels an unfinished one.
 *   - Annotations stay drawn while the Measurement Tool owns the scene, but only as a view: markers and cards
 *     take no pointer or keyboard input until that mode ends (the Editor wires `isSceneToolOwnedElsewhere`).
 *   - Cargo anchors are only ever picked from, and resolved against, COMMITTED poses; while the Editor
 *     owns a provisional pose a pick on cargo is refused. Overlay positions follow the pose the scene
 *     displays so a marker never floats away from cargo that is being dragged or animated.
 *   - An unresolvable annotation stays stored and is listed with an explanation; it is never drawn at a
 *     fabricated position and never relocated. The only way an anchor changes is the owner's deliberate
 *     marker drag or Re-attach onto a supported surface.
