> **Current source-of-truth note (2026-07-05):** `main` / `origin/main` include the AutoPack Core Engine epic through `5a530f0`. The only known project-wide gate issue is pre-existing 87-file formatting drift under `npm run validate`; do not auto-format the AutoPack Core Engine merge. Next action is the focused `cleanup/autopack-item-prep` branch.

## AutoPack Core Engine Epic — Merged Evidence (2026-07-05, `5a530f0`)

### Status
- Epic branch `epic/autopack-core-engine` was fast-forward merged and pushed to `main`.
- Final main commit after merge: `5a530f0`.
- Automated validation is green.
- Production AutoPack routes through packing-core/adaptive strategy selection.
- Multiple-solution foundation exists internally.
- Floating AutoPack Results panel exists in the 3D canvas area.
- Results panel shows “Best load selected” for one option and “X more options available” when alternates exist.
- Front Overhang retained-section deck loading works.
- Wheel Wells support/containment fixes are in.
- Duplicate packed placement now physically validates support/retention before staying packed.
- Category selection from the Inspector exists.
- Stale test contracts were updated.
- E2B baseline was updated.
- Do not auto-format this branch.

### Validation evidence
- `git diff --check` passed
- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed: `763 pass`, `5 skipped`, `0 fail`
- `npm run test:stress` passed: `20 pass`, `0 fail`
- `npm run test:all` passed: `768 pass`, `0 fail`
- `npm run lint` passed with warnings only
- `npm run validate` still fails only because `format:check` reports existing formatting drift across 87 files

### Commit evidence
- `2ef7902` fix(autopack): resolve pre-merge safety blockers
- `1cc0fc3` test(autopack): update core engine validation contracts
- `55b490f` test(autopack): update E2B solver baseline
- `817a5bc` fix(lint): remove extra boolean cast

### Merge gate result
Manual browser smoke was acceptable enough to merge. Known follow-up: the AutoPack Results panel is functional but needs future design refinement. Existing 87-file format drift remains a separate decision and should not be mixed into AutoPack cleanup work.

### Architecture note
This is a validated bridge architecture, not a full solver deletion/rewrite. `packing-core` now owns shared validation, strategy/result envelopes, budgets, wheel-well support model, retention coverage, repair helpers, and diagnostics, but `autopack-solver.js` still owns most placement search/scoring/phase sequencing. Cleanup must continue in smaller branches after merge.

## AutoPack Quality Wave — Front Overhang, Wheel Wells, Layer Quality, Performance, and Operation UX (2026-06-24)

### Status summary
- ✅ **Merged to main (`e9c86c0`)**: Phase C/C2/D + truck-change preview cleanup. The raised Front Overhang deck is no longer treated as immediately usable; it requires rear retention. Truck layout changes now render an ephemeral preview instead of showing the old load behind a new-truck modal.
- 🔄 **Validated local stack, not merged**: Operation lifecycle branch `fix/editor-operation-lifecycle-ux` is validated locally (`714/714` tests, lint `0 errors`, existing warnings only). Wheel-well foundation branch `fix/autopack-wheelwell-support-stability` is stacked on it and validated (`723/723` tests; Codex PASS; typecheck and diff checks passed per Codex). Merge lifecycle first, then rebase/validate and merge Wheel-well.
- 🟡 **Wheel-well foundation status**: `da9e099` adds safe wheel-well contact/support validation and `46671fc` adds a gated support-build/bridge foundation. Bridge/build-up generation remains OFF in production unless `enableWheelWellBridge` is explicitly passed. Wheel-well validation is production-active and can reject blocked-body penetration or unsafe support in Wheel Wells.
- ✅ **Manual editor safety blockers fixed locally**: `97b2a8e` blocks manual Wheel-well body placements; `d3580a3` revalidates stacked dependents after manual delete/move/rotate/nudge/apply so unsupported children do not float. Browser smoke passed on Wheel Wells.

### What is fixed in the current candidate
- **Standard mode**: identical 24×18×16, cube, and 42×10×16 cases are now mostly clean. Remaining rear empty space for partial loads is expected unused trailer length, not a solver gap.
- **Wheel Wells**: the channel can be a clean primary block plus a valid alternate-yaw filler strip when the geometry requires it. E2B prevents channel stack drift by making upper channel layers follow the footprint below.
- **Front Overhang safety**: deck cargo requires a rear retaining wall at the step. Unsafe deck-first loading was stopped.
- **Truck-change preview**: modal and scene now describe the same proposed truck/cargo state; failed items are staged in preview and raw UUIDs are not shown as primary user-facing labels.
- **Large-load snap safety**: loads with more than 300 packed placements now skip long per-object animation and write final packed state before animation. This is a safety/performance foundation, not the final operation UX.

### Known remaining issues / decisions
1. ⚠️ **Operation lifecycle / UX concurrency gap** — AutoPack, Unpack, Truck Change, preview capture, and animation can still feel unsynchronized. Large loads may show “AutoPack starting…” with no visible progress for 10–20 seconds, Unpack can delay, Truck Change can open preview before explicit Update, and users have no clear stop/cancel behavior. Audit before implementation.
2. ⚠️ **Large-load performance still has a synchronous solve/render wait** — the long animation path is skipped after `05f56f4`, but solving/building/rendering many cases can still block the main thread. The next fix should improve perceived responsiveness and operation messaging before deeper architecture like Web Workers.
3. ⚠️ **Wheel-well manual movement blocked-body defect** — automated solver validation now models wheel-well blocked bodies, tops, side contact, and stable support, but manual editor movement can still let a case pass through / into wheel-well blocked volumes. Fix editor containment/collision for drag, move, rotate, nudge, and drop before merge.
4. 🔄 **Wheel-well support/stability foundation** — implemented and tested, Codex PASS. Bridge/build-up generation is gated OFF unless `enableWheelWellBridge` is passed. Do not enable it yet; create a later activation/order branch after foundation merge.
5. ⬜ **Front Overhang wall-building strategy** — C2 blocks unsafe deck usage, but the solver does not intentionally build the retaining wall first and then fill the deck. The deck can remain unused until this strategy exists.
6. ⬜ **Manual vertical placement** — user needs to select a case, move it up/down, snap it onto another case, and leave it there if support/collision/stack/orientation rules pass.
7. ⬜ **Organized Unpack** — unpack should create clean grouped staging rows, not random scattered placement.

### Current AutoPack implementation order
1. 🔄 **Legacy item-prep cleanup branch** — extract live item prep before deleting legacy solver code.
2. ⬜ **Formatting-only branch if `validate` is treated as a hard gate** — isolate the existing 87-file formatting drift; do not auto-format AutoPack work.
3. ⬜ **Manual vertical placement** — allow rule-validated vertical drag/snap/place.
4. ⬜ **AutoPack solution portfolio expansion** — expose richer alternate strategy labels/options after cleanup priorities.
5. ⬜ **`app.js` modularization inventory** — start with M0 inventory, not extraction.
6. ⬜ **Organized Unpack polish** — clean grouped staging layout.

### AutoPack / UI follow-up
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **AutoPack Results panel UI enhancement** — current panel is functional but visually clunky. Improve button styling to match the app’s design system; replace the long expanded list with a compact carousel/slide pattern when multiple load options exist; add previous/next arrows to cycle through load options; add a small drag handle in the upper-left corner so users know the panel can be moved; keep it floating, compact, non-modal, and draggable. Do not implement until after the merge and cleanup priorities are complete. |

### Important product rules from recent audits
- A layout can pass containment/collision/support tests and still fail product quality. Hard-rule validity and load-planning quality must both be evaluated.
- Do not remove alternate yaw in Wheel Wells when it fills real usable floor space. Instead, keep it as an organized contiguous filler strip.
- Do not treat Wheel Wells as only blockers. Their tops are raised support surfaces for cases that fit, and future bridge support should allow wider cases only when enough base support exists.
- Manual editor movement must enforce the same Wheel-well blocked-body safety as solver validation. A case may touch, sit on top, or later bridge only when support/stability rules pass; it must never pass through the wheel-well body.
- Do not treat Front Overhang as free floor. Deck loading requires rear retention; future strategy must build that retention first.
- Large-load animation must not be required for the data model to reach its final packed state.
- AutoPack, Unpack, and Truck Change are mutually disruptive operations. The UI may show active progress/spinners, but the code must prevent repeated operations, stale animations, premature truck-change reconciliation, and final-state dependence on animation completion.

> **Safety constants unchanged:** `CONTAINMENT_EPS_INCHES = 0.05`, `MIN_SUPPORT_FRACTION = 0.5`. No billing/auth/workspace/membership/security/Supabase code was touched.

## Repair 1E — Wheel Wells front-first stack scoring (2026-06-18, `3dc9a3b`)
*Branch `fix/wheelwells-front-first-stack-scoring`, FF-merged. Suite: **645 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean (mine). Files: `src/services/autopack-solver.js`, tests.*

**Root cause.** The live stack-candidate score tuple (`scoreStackCandidate`, used by `findStackPlacement` for both the main solve and repack) was `[bottomY, -supportFraction, wasteArea, xPrimary, minZ]`. Because `wasteArea` came before `xPrimary`, among equally valid same-level candidates (equal support fraction) the lower-waste option won regardless of front position. In front-first modes — especially Wheel Wells, where front floor cells are full-width and the middle is segmented — center/rear supports received stacked items while valid front supports were left empty.

**Scoring tuple before/after.** before `[bottomY, -supportFraction, wasteArea, xPrimary, minZ]` → after `[bottomY, -supportFraction, xPrimary, wasteArea, minZ]`. Smallest safe change: swap two adjacent elements. Front wins before support waste; waste retained as the next tie-break. Hard rules (containment, collision, support fraction, support capacity, no-top-load, max direct children, orientation) are filtered before scoring, so a front candidate is never forced when invalid. `scoreStackCandidate` is the single shared tuple, so main-solve and repack stay consistent. Floor/lane/repeated-batch/filler/compaction scoring untouched.

**188 / 420 results (Wheel Wells, production Standard Carton 24, 24×18×16).** 188 → all 188 pack; floor 40, stacked 148 across 5 levels; the partial top level (28 children on 40 supports) fills **front** supports (used minX≈81) and leaves only **rear** ones empty (unused maxX≈51) — every used support more front than every unused one (before the fix: used minX=15, unused maxX=195 — rear filled, front empty). 420 → 240 pack to capacity (top level fully used), front-first fill order, all safety properties hold. Both: no overlap, all contained (no OOB/blocked-zone), every stacked item supported ≥ `MIN_SUPPORT_FRACTION`, THREE-consistent dims, deterministic on repeat.

**Regression results.** Standard mode still stacks front-first; `maxStackCount` 1 and 2 still cap direct children; Repair 1–1D tests remain green (645 total).

**Files changed.** `src/services/autopack-solver.js` (the swap + `export` for the unit test), `tests/audit/security-and-invariants.spec.mjs`.

**Still open (signed-in only):** signed-in editor visual confirmation that Wheel Wells fills front stacks first. **Preserved untouched:** two unrelated uncommitted local edits in the working tree (`index.html` label case, one `styles/main.css` line) — never staged or modified.

## Repair 1D — Atomic pre-solver scene staging (2026-06-18, `c47d9ef`)
*Branch `fix/autopack-atomic-prescene-staging`, FF-merged. Suite: **640 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean (mine). Files: `src/services/autopack-engine.js`, tests.*

**Defect:** `stageInstant()` applied only the staged **position**, then `pack()` awaited two animation frames (`waitForAnimationFrames(2)`) before the final stored pose. During those frames the THREE object still had its **old rotation and `userData.halfWorld`**, so it rendered at the new staging Y with the wrong bounds — the visible transient float (old onSide `144×8×8` beam: staged Y=72 but rendered 8in tall → bottom ≈68in above the floor).

**Fix:** `stageInstant()` now applies **position + rotation + oriented halfWorld** in one synchronous pass from the same `buildStagedPose` result (mirroring the values `prepareObjectForPlacement` already applies for packed items). No frame wait between the values, so the rendered THREE bounds match the staged pose on every frame — not only after the StateStore update. Packed-placement handling unchanged. No engine-flow, solver, staging-grid, fixture, zone, billing/auth or safety-constant changes.

**Before/after (frame values, old onSide `144×8×8` beam):** staging frames — before `posY=72, sizeY=8, minY=68` (floating); after `posY=72, sizeY=144, minY=0` (rotated, on floor).

**Evidence (runtime, real `createAutoPackEngine.pack()` with real THREE objects + a controllable `requestAnimationFrame` that captures every scheduled frame):** old onSide beam — former ~68in gap is 0 on every frame and the object is actually rotated (rendered 144in tall); corrected upright Long Beams stay on the floor every frame; an exact compound lock stages atomically (rendered 20in); a packed pose that differs from the staging pose never floats and scene == StateStore at the end; running AutoPack twice stays clean; Standard/Wheel-Wells/Front-Overhang have no float frames and packed placements remain contained, non-overlapping and THREE-consistent. Best-effort **real-browser** (Chromium, real `requestAnimationFrame`): the old onSide beam renders `minY=0, sizeY=144` on every frame (`maxFloat=0`), 0 console errors.

**Still open (signed-in only):** signed-in editor must show no transient floating frame when AutoPack stages an item. **Separate (pre-existing, not addressed here):** the exact-instance-lock unlock affordance noted in Repair 1C; two unrelated uncommitted local edits in the working tree (`index.html` label case, one `styles/main.css` line) were left untouched.

## Repair 1C — Long Beam orientation rule-contract (2026-06-18, `038028a`)
*Branch `fix/long-beam-orientation-rule-contract`, FF-merged. Suite: **634 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean.*

**Classification: D + E — engine correct, fixture wrong.** The Long Beam fixtures declared `orientationLock:onSide`. Per the approved contract (`onSide` = supported side orientations only, height axis non-vertical), for a `144×8×8` beam `buildOrientationCandidates` returns `8×8×144` (Z90, **144in tall**, `orientations[0]`) and `8×144×8` — the natural horizontal lengthwise pose (`144×8×8`, identity = upright) is **excluded**. Neither onSide candidate fits a trailer (too tall / 144in too wide), so AutoPack correctly left the beam unpacked and (Repair 1B) staged it standing 144in tall. Manual horizontal rotation created an **exact instance lock** at identity which, per the documented precedence (exact lock > case policy > flip), overrode onSide → the second run fit. **Both behaviors are correct.**

**Source/runtime proof:** `buildOrientationCandidates(144×8×8)` — onSide excludes the `144×8×8` identity pose and includes `8×8×144`; upright/any include `144×8×8` and never exceed the 8in case height. `solveAutoPack` packs the beam horizontally lengthwise under upright/any/exact-lock, but leaves it unpacked under onSide.

**Fix (data + copy only; no engine change):** set both Long Beams to `orientationLock:upright` (canFlip:false; lane Always/Never preserved) in `cargo_cases_valid.csv` **and** `.xlsx` (kept row-equivalent; parity verified; CSV normalized to LF so `diff --check` is clean). `onSide` is **not** weakened — the dedicated `Alias OnSide/onside/on-side/on_side` rows and the `On-Side Roll` (a cylinder, legitimately onSide) still cover onSide/alias. Small case-modal orientation help-text clarification (upright keeps the height axis vertical / on side tips it) to prevent the same confusion. `cargo_rule_test_matrix.xlsx` and `README.txt` recorded no beam-onSide assumption, so were left unchanged.

**Before/after rule:** Long Beam 144 — `On Side` → `Upright` (lane Always); Long Beam No Lane — `On-Side` → `Upright` (lane Never). Candidate set for `144×8×8` changes from {`8×8×144`, `8×144×8`} (onSide) to {`144×8×8`, `8×144×8`} (upright). Manual rotation previously fit because the exact lock outranks the case policy.

**Evidence (runtime, production import + AutoPack):** upright keeps the lengthwise pose / never stands tall; onSide excludes identity; lane Always **and** Never both pack horizontal; manual exact-lock before/after; an unfittable upright beam stages atomic on the floor (horizontal); Standard/Wheel-Wells/Front-Overhang (WheelWells legitimately can't fit a 144in beam — its usable zones are segmented to ≤96in, engine correct); placed items THREE-correct, contained, no overlap, no out-of-bounds; CSV and XLSX import identically. Best-effort **headless-Chromium**: corrected fixture imported via the production parser, AutoPack run for both beams in all three modes — both import `upright`, pack horizontal (render height 8/10, THREE floor gap 0) where a lane exists, 0 console errors.

**Still open (signed-in only):** signed-in editor must show both beams importing/adding as upright and packing horizontally (Standard + Front Overhang), with no initial floating frame. **Follow-up (separate, not blocking):** verify whether the Inspector offers a reachable way to clear an exact instance lock created by manual rotation — an unlock affordance may be worth adding in a later UI phase (not added here).

---

## Repair 1B — Atomic staged-pose contract (2026-06-18, `97450ea`)
*Branch `fix/autopack-atomic-staged-pose`, FF-merged. Suite: **627 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean.*

**Defect (pre-existing engine contract, exposed by the new fixtures):** when AutoPack could not pack an item, the staging Y was computed from one orientation's dimensions (the first orientation candidate — e.g. an onSide beam standing 144in tall), but the saved rotation fell back to identity and `orientedDims` was deleted, so the render reverted to base case dims. Position and (rotation, orientedDims) described different orientations → staged items floated. Codex repro: **Long Beam 144** staged y=72, rendered height 8, bottom ≈68in above floor; **Long Beam No Lane** staged y=60, rendered height 10, bottom ≈55in. Packed solver placements were correct; only the staged/unpacked pose was wrong.

**Contract (chosen):** the staged pose is atomic — `position + rotation + orientedDims` all describe the SAME deterministic valid orientation, namely the first AutoPack orientation candidate (already honors instance lock, case `orientationLock`, `canFlip`; its dims are THREE-derived per Repair 1). Therefore `saved orientedDims == getOrientedDimsForRotation(case, rotation) == THREE Box3`, and the rendered bottom == staging floor. *Reason:* this is the engine's existing RC-4 intent (stage in the candidate orientation, not stale dims); the only bug was that rotation/orientedDims weren't persisted with the position. Retaining the pre-AutoPack rotation was rejected — it would re-introduce a mixed contract and violate onSide/upright policy.

**Fix:** `buildStagedPose(item)` is now a module-scope **exported** helper returning the candidate `{ dims, rotation }`; `buildStagingMap` stores `{ position, rotation, orientedDims }` together; the `nextCases` persist step applies all three for staged items (non-identity keeps `orientedDims`; identity drops it since base dims match). Packed handling unchanged. Files: `src/services/autopack-engine.js` (+ tests). No new imports; `oriented-dims`/solver/pack-library untouched.

**Before/after (both beams, via production code):** Long Beam 144 → stagingY 72, rotation Z90, orientedDims `8×8×144`, bottom **68→0**; Long Beam No Lane → stagingY 60, rotation Z90, orientedDims `10×10×120`, bottom **55→0**. onSide honored (not staged upright).

**Evidence (runtime + THREE-backed):** atomic-pose-on-floor; Long Beam fixtures imported through the production CSV parser don't float; Standard/Wheel-Wells/Front-Overhang all rest on floor; orientation-policy staging matrix (any/upright/onSide × canFlip, exact + compound lock) with pose/rotation/dims/THREE agreement; deterministic pose ignoring stale instance orientedDims/rotation; packed placements stay on the floor and Stats/OOG use the same dims. Best-effort **headless-Chromium**: production import + staging composed in a real browser, a THREE object built from the saved pose rests on the floor (`floorGap=0`) for both beams in all three modes, 0 console errors.

**Still open (signed-in only):** the signed-in editor must show both staged Long Beams resting correctly with no new visual/console defect. **Do not mark Repair 1B complete until then.**

## Repair 1 — AutoPack orientation candidate geometry (2026-06-18, `5fabab1`)
*Branch `fix/autopack-orientation-candidate-geometry`, FF-merged. Suite: **621 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean.*

**Defect:** AutoPack stored a candidate rotation alongside a separately handwritten dimension permutation. For compound right angles they disagreed — case `30×20×10` at `X90+Z90` renders `10×30×20` in THREE, but the candidate reported `20×10×30`, so the solver could accept the item in a `20×10×30` truck while the rendered mesh was 30in wide. Containment/collision/Stats/OOG/saved `orientedDims` all agreed with each other while wrong vs the editor mesh.

**Fix:** Rotation is now the single source of truth. Both the active `buildOrientationCandidates` (autopack-solver) and the live legacy `buildOrientations` (reached via `buildLegacyAutoPackItems`) store the right-angle rotation and **derive** dimensions from it through the shared `getOrientedDimsForRotation` helper. All hardcoded permutation tables removed; dedup keys use the derived dims. Also corrected a legacy contract bug: `upright + canFlip:true` used `lock !== 'onSide'` and tipped the item; now `lock === 'any'` (upright stays upright), matching the active solver. `solveLegacyAutoPack` (dead) untouched. `oriented-dims.js` reused unchanged.

**Live vs dead:** live — `buildOrientationCandidates`, `solveAutoPack`, `buildLegacyAutoPackItems`, `buildOrientations` (its `orientations[0]` feeds staging). Dead — `solveLegacyAutoPack`.

**Evidence (runtime tests):** THREE-`Box3` candidate matrix over real production candidates (identity/single/compound/negative/270°/>360° + locked); the `30×20×10` `X90+Z90` regression (candidate is `10×30×20`, never `20×10×30`; solver placements stay in-bounds and THREE-consistent; the item packs via the honest `20×10×30` `X90+Y90` face); Standard/Wheel-Wells/Front-Overhang containment + no-overlap; active-vs-live-legacy agreement incl. upright+canFlip never tipping; dedup (cube ⇒ 1). Best-effort **headless-Chromium** check loaded the production module in a real browser and compared 12 candidates against the browser's own THREE `Box3` — 0 mismatches, 0 console errors.

**Still open (signed-in only):** visible 3D orientation, collision/containment/Stats/OOG agreement, AutoPack across all three truck modes, drag/rotate/flip — none verified signed-in. **Do not mark Repair 1 complete until signed-in browser checks pass.**

## Cargo-Rule V1 Contract (approved 2026-06-17)
*Source-verified against `main` @ `819d3de`. This is the authoritative meaning of every cargo rule the V1 UI may expose. Do not expose a rule the active solver does not honor exactly as written here.*

### Approved V1 rule meanings (active in `autopack-solver.js` unless noted)
- **`canFlip`** — canonical default **`false`** everywhere. Meaning: AutoPack may tip the item onto another face **only** when `true` **and** the orientation policy allows it.
- **`orientationLock`** — canonical stored values **`any` / `upright` / `onSide`**. Precedence: (1) valid instance exact lock → (2) case orientation policy → (3) flip permission. Meanings: `any`+`canFlip:false` = upright yaw only; `any`+`canFlip:true` = all allowed right-angle faces; **`upright` = upright yaw only regardless of `canFlip`**; **`onSide` = supported side orientations only regardless of `canFlip`**; valid instance lock = one exact candidate.
- **`noStackOnTop`** — nothing may rest directly on this case. **Support-side only**; it does NOT force the case itself to the floor.
- **`maxStackCount`** — max **direct child** items resting on **one** support. `0` = unlimited. **Not** total tower height.
- **`isPallet`** — treat as pallet/load base. Current solver behavior: allows heavier items to rest on it by **bypassing the normal child-vs-support weight check**. Global support fraction (0.5) still applies. **No hard pallet capacity enforcement.**
- **`maxPalletWeight`** — **warning-only** (`oog-service.computePalletWarnings`, cumulative footprint sum). May be shown only as a "Max load (warning)"; must **never** appear to block AutoPack.
- **`laneItem`** — tri-state: Automatic=`null`, Always=`true`, Never=`false`.
- **`loadPriority`** — **soft tie-breaker only** (sort key after footprint/weight). Never present as a guaranteed load sequence. Per-instance override is currently dropped by `normalizeInstance` (case-level only in V1).

### Display-parity requirement (PERMANENT — not optional polish)
After a case is saved, **every active non-default handling rule MUST be shown consistently** in: **Cases grid cards · Cases list view · Editor Case Browser · Selected-case Inspector · Import preview · Pack reports/manifests (later)**. The Case modal must **never** be the only place a user can see rules that affect AutoPack. This requirement must not be forgotten or downgraded to polish. (Pack report/manifest parity is a written future requirement until actually implemented.)

### Persistence-parity requirement
CSV/XLSX, JSON import/export, duplication, reload, workspace switching, and pack export/import must preserve the **same** cargo-rule meanings (canonical values, defaults, and round-trip equality for every field above).

### Deferred — do NOT expose as completed AutoPack rules in V1
Fragile · floorOnly · floorOrPallet · baseOnly · stackingPolicy · hard pallet capacity · maximum supported weight · maximum total stack height · cumulative tower-weight **enforcement** · hazmat · temperature · securement · dunnage · airflow · mustLoadLast · mustUnloadFirst · stopGroup · keepTogetherGroup · deliverySequence · legal payload / axle claims · round/cylinder collision behavior. These remain future solver work; inert fields must stay hidden.

## Cargo-Rule V1 — Integrity Correction Wave (2026-06-18, after two independent Codex audits)
*Two independent Codex validations (incl. a Graphify-assisted audit) reached the same FAIL verdict on `main` @ `9f1116e`. The repeated findings were treated as confirmed defects and fixed forward across 8 branches (each its own FF merge). Final suite: **616 tests pass / 0 fail**, lint **0 errors** (pre-existing warnings only), typecheck clean, `git diff --check` clean. `main` = `7000f96`.*

**Status: Implemented and locally verified; awaiting independent Codex validation and signed-in browser review. Cargo-Rule V1 is NOT marked complete.**

- **Integrity Phase 1 — Canonical THREE oriented dims (`9c78aa6`)** — the oriented-dimension math applied right-angle swaps in X→Y→Z order (computes Rz·Ry·Rx); THREE Euler `XYZ` is Rx·Ry·Rz (effective Z→Y→X). Single-axis rotations agreed but **every compound rotation diverged**, corrupting containment/collision/packed-staged/Stats/out-of-gauge for rotated items. New single pure helper `src/core/oriented-dims.js` matches THREE exactly; `normalizer`, `pack-library`, and the solver all route through it (two of the three prior copies were buggy). `normalizeInstance` treats the case definition as authoritative and never invents dims. **Proof: helper compared against a real THREE `Box3` for every right-angle combo; restore matrix for App/Workspace/Pack/batch/autosave.** *(This supersedes the earlier single-axis-only App-Backup oriented-dims claim.)*
- **Integrity Phase 2 — Atomic pack import (`2c153af`)** — import wrote bundled cases one-by-one and could crash mid-loop on a malformed later case, leaving orphans; blank `caseId` bypassed the missing-ref gate. Split into a pure `planPackImport()` (parse/validate/canonicalize/plan with **zero** state mutation) + a single atomic `StateStore.set`. **Proof: byte-equivalent before/after on malformed first/middle/last bundled case, blank-caseId rejection, failure-after-planned-conflict, three-import idempotence, planner purity.**
- **Integrity Phase 3 — Typed canonical cargo representation (`3fd2c72`)** — comparison/fingerprint used JS truthiness + `Number()||0`, so `"false"`→true, malformed numbers→silent 0, invalid≡valid-default, raw≠stored, decimal stack counts inconsistent. New `src/core/cargo-canonical.js` is the single typed source for model/normalizer/upsert/spreadsheet/import/compare. Booleans accept `true/false`, `yes/no`, `1/0` only (unknown→invalid→default, never truthiness); numbers reject malformed/NaN/Infinity and clamp to data-sanity limits (1e300 can no longer make infinite volume); `maxStackCount` floors consistently; lane keeps Automatic/Always/Never distinct. In comparison an invalid value gets a distinct sentinel so it never equals a valid default. **Comparison-identity decision: manufacturer + category are display taxonomy and are EXCLUDED from physical equivalence/fingerprint; `name` + physical/handling fields define equivalence; on reuse the existing local case's metadata is authoritative.** Safe extensions survive normalize/backup/workspace; prototype keys/functions/non-finite values are dropped.
- **Integrity Phase 4 — Orientation parsing single source (`62af797`)** — `repeatedBatchKey()` keyed on raw orientation spelling (aliases failed to batch) and the live `buildOrientations()` (via `buildLegacyAutoPackItems`) lowercased and missed `on-side`. Both now use `canonicalOrientationLock`. Removed the test-only `parseLaneCell` (duplicated production). The dead `solveLegacyAutoPack` was intentionally left (guarded by existing "unused" tests). **Proof: `repeatedBatchKey`/legacy item-prep are alias-invariant yet keep onSide and upright distinct.**
- **Integrity Phase 5 — Dangling reference reporting (`eda7d26`)** — removed fabricated 24×24×24 fallbacks from editor placement/unpack; `computeStats` adds `stagedCases` + completeness flags (`totalsComplete`/`weightComplete`/`volumeComplete`/`utilizationComplete`). Surfaces: Stats panel unresolved row + incomplete-totals note, single-selection Delete action, multi-selection unresolved note, Packs grid count, AutoPack exclusion toast, PDF summary line + checklist id, and an export `unresolvedCaseRefs`/note. Unresolved items stay stored/exportable, never crash, never a valid AutoPack item.
- **Integrity Phase 6 — Spreadsheet preview warning details (`b829ec8`)** — per-row structured warnings (`field` / supplied `value` / `fallback` / `reason`) shown on the affected preview row (e.g. `canFlip: "maybe" is invalid; using No`), visually distinct from blocking errors; the downloadable report uses the same messages; data-sanity limits flag extreme values. **Proof: real CSV and real XLSX File objects parsed through the production parser (not helpers) with CSV/XLSX parity.**
- **Integrity Phase 7 — Handling dependency contract (`c57a7cf`)** — no-top-load **preserves** the saved `maxStackCount` (disabled field, solver ignores it via the noStackOnTop gate) instead of zeroing it; pallet + no-top-load shows "This pallet is marked 'No top load,' so AutoPack will not place cargo on it"; the pallet warning value stays **dormant** when not a pallet; manual-rotation block by case orientation policy no longer mislabels itself as "orientation-locked". Orientation distinction documented/tested (canFlip = AutoPack tipping; manual exact lock allowed under `any`; upright blocks both; instance lock overrides). *(This supersedes the earlier "zeroes maxStackCount under no-top-load" claim.)*
- **Integrity Phase 8 — Restore round-trip matrix (`7000f96`)** — one hostile case driven through modal-save sink, duplicate, CSV sink, App/Workspace/autosave normalize, Pack JSON, Pack batch, and undo/redo. Exposed and fixed forward a real gap: `CaseLibrary.buildStorableCase` could store a function-valued extension and crash autosave's `structuredClone`; it now sanitizes extension fields at the storage boundary.

---

## Cargo-Rule V1 — Completion Evidence (2026-06-17 base build + P1 fixes)
*All code phases merged to `main` via fast-forward, each on its own branch. Earlier wave suite: 572 tests pass / 0 fail. The figures below predate the 2026-06-18 integrity wave (now `main` = `7000f96`, 616 tests).*

### P1 defect fixes (independent audit @ `b54eccb` → fixed)
- **P1 orientation aliases (`b735fed`)** — one canonical helper `src/core/orientation.js` used by normalizer, case model, solver, pack-library (comparator + manual-rotate policy), case-rule-summary, modal, and the spreadsheet parser. `on-side` / `"on side"` no longer reload as `any` or produce zero solver candidates. **⚠️ The "all paths canonical" claim was too broad — `repeatedBatchKey()` and the live legacy item-prep still parsed raw orientation; corrected in Integrity Phase 4 (`62af797`).**
- **P1 pack-import idempotence (`573d074`)** — conflict-imported cases are stamped with a deterministic canonical `importSourceKey`; repeated conflicting imports reuse the first `(Imported)` case (no `(Imported 2)/(Imported 3)`). Survives reload (preserved by `normalizeCase`). `laneItem:false` stays distinct from Automatic. Decision: manufacturer/category are identity; color/notes are presentation-only.
- **P1 unresolved/dangling refs (`31a6ea5`)** — pack/batch import is blocked (throws, no side effect, names the missing ids) when an instance has no resolvable case; existing dangling local instances now surface via `computeStats.unresolvedInstances`, an editor Inspector "Unresolved case" card, and an AutoPack "items excluded" toast; export preserves the dangling caseId; never silently deleted.
- **P1 App-Backup oriented dims (`c54d8f8`)** — `normalizeInstance` no longer ties `orientedDims` to `orientationLocked`; for any non-identity rotation it recomputes effective dims authoritatively from case dims + rotation (preserving stored only when the case is missing). **⚠️ This fix was correct for single-axis rotations only — compound right-angle rotations diverged from THREE and were corrected in Integrity Phase 1 (`9c78aa6`).**
- **P2 contract enforcement (`f397f3c`)** — `CaseLibrary.upsert` canonicalizes known cargo fields (and floors `maxStackCount`) while preserving unknown/extension fields; both normalizers floor decimal `maxStackCount`; spreadsheet import warns on invalid boolean/lane cells; the modal clears legacy `stackable:false` when no-top-load is unchecked and the lane copy now says Always is a preference. **⚠️ The original "zeroes `maxStackCount` under no-top-load" behavior was reversed in Integrity Phase 7 (`c57a7cf`): the saved count is now preserved (disabled field, solver ignores it). The typed boolean/numeric canonicalization was superseded by `core/cargo-canonical.js` in Integrity Phase 3 (`3fd2c72`); extension sanitizing at the storage boundary was added in Integrity Phase 8 (`7000f96`).**

### Base build (2026-06-17)

- **Phase 2 (`b434adf`)** — `canFlip` defaults to `false` everywhere: new-case modal (`case-modal.js`), `normalizeCase` (core + model), CSV import. Preset exception: **Truss Section keeps `canFlip:true`** (square cross-section, intentional). JBL Subwoofer Crate preset corrected to `false`. Tests: `CARGO-RULE-V1 canFlip defaults…`.
- **Phase 3 (`c0fe57d`)** — `autopack-solver.js` orientation: tipped faces only when policy is `any`, so `orientationLock:'upright'` is honored even with `canFlip:true`; matches the manual-rotate policy. Tests: 7-row orientation truth table + policy agreement.
- **Phase 4 (`6a17e67`)** — `importPackPayload` compares cargo-defining fields before reusing a local case by id/name; on conflict it creates a new `(Imported)` case, remaps instances, never overwrites local, reports `caseConflicts` (toast, single + batch). *(Note: the original "equivalent re-import is idempotent" and "dangling refs already safe" claims were only partly true — repeated conflicts grew names and dangling refs were silent. Both corrected in the P1 wave above: `573d074`, `31a6ea5`.)*
- **Phase 5 (`957b5eb`)** — Case modal "Handling Rules" section exposes only solver-honored rules with canonical save mapping + dependencies (upright/on-side disable flipping; no-top-load disables max-on-top; pallet warning visible only for pallets). `maxPalletWeight` labeled **warning only**. Hidden/deferred fields preserved via `...initial`.
- **Phase 6 (`c5e5c56`)** — `src/services/case-rule-summary.js` is the **single source** for active non-default rule chips, shown in Cases cards, Cases list (Flip→Handling column), Editor Case Browser, and the Inspector (case rules vs this-item lock separately). 3D pallet label fixed: `Max: X lb` → `Warning limit: X lb`.
- **Phase 7 (`e9ebb8a`)** — CSV/XLSX import reads all eight handling fields (aliases); canonical `onSide`; invalid cells warn and fall back to default (row still imports); template matches the parser exactly; the **spreadsheet (CSV/XLSX) import preview** shows a **Handling** column via the shared summary; 10MB/5000-row limits unchanged. *(Scope note: this is the spreadsheet preview only — the **Pack JSON / batch import preview** still has no handling-rule or predicted-conflict column; that remains future UI work.)*
- **Phase 8 (`dc32d9a`)** — round-trip proofs: pack JSON export→import and `normalizeAppData` preserve every handling rule; export/download action chains verified; **workspace import remains intentionally unwired** (parser exists, no UI) and the misleading pack-batch guard message was corrected.

### Still open (not done in this workstream)
- 🔄 **Independent Codex re-validation of the integrity wave** — the 2026-06-18 wave is implemented and locally verified only. AutoPack 5B and the broad visual UI pass remain blocked until a fresh independent validation passes.
- 🔄 **Browser visual/UX sign-off** (signed-in): the new handling UI/display + the integrity-wave UI surfaces (Stats unresolved row/incomplete-totals note, per-row spreadsheet warnings, pallet + no-top-load copy, corrected manual-rotation error text, AutoPack exclusion toast) across desktop/narrow/tablet/mobile + light/dark, no console errors. **This is the open UI visual review — do NOT mark it complete.**
- 🔄 **3B + 5A** signed-in interactive editor checklist (unchanged; still required).
- ⬜ **Pack JSON / batch import preview parity** — show handling-rule chips + predicted conflict/missing-case result in the pack-import preview (P2; spreadsheet preview already has it).
- ⬜ **Workspace import UI** — `parseWorkspaceImportJSON` exists but is deliberately not wired; build the import UI before advertising workspace import. (The pack-batch guard no longer points to a missing "Import Workspace Backup" action.)
- ⬜ **Visual/accessibility P2/P3 polish** (deferred to the dedicated UI phase, not started here): modal labels not `<label>`-associated, no mobile one-column modal breakpoint, no disabled-input styling, default `Flip: No` still on grid cards, list handling cell uses `display:flex`, warning/priority chips share hard-rule styling, Case Browser rule density.
- 🚫 **Deferred cargo rules** (unchanged, future solver work): Fragile, `stackingPolicy`/floorOnly/floorOrPallet/baseOnly, hard pallet capacity, max supported weight, max stack height, cumulative tower-weight enforcement, multi-stop fields, hazmat, multiple AutoPack strategies / Fits-All. Also future: Pack **batch export** producer/UI (none exists).

## Release Gate Rule
Release-gate items block **public launch**, not isolated product development. Product phases may continue on separate branches but must never be mixed into billing/auth/security patches.

## PART 1 — RELEASE GATE (P0 Hard Blockers)

### 1A — Billing Foundation
| Status | Item | Evidence |
|--------|------|----------|

| ✅ | Trial-expired soft lock (modal, AutoPack gate, PDF gate) | Browser verified test3 |
| ✅ | Trial-expired lock persists through idle, focus, and billing fetch errors | test3 idle + tab-switch |
| ✅ | Past-due grace window (banner, owner portal link, hard block after grace) | Implemented + code review |
| ✅ | `billing_customers` uniqueness + index guardrails applied | Migration + DB verify |
| ✅ | Checkout idempotency key includes `organizationId` | Commit `f5cc8cd` + test 272/272 |

| 🔄 | Portal manual sign-off: User4 deep-link, User1 schedule-managed, test1 stale-sub | — |
| ✅ | DB health checks Q1–Q6 all clean on production | 2026-05-08 live run |
| ✅ | Webhook idempotency — duplicate event returns 200, no re-processing | Audit test |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-01** — Cross-user billing state contamination (~5s window) on in-tab sign-in without page reload. `tp3d:active-org-id` keeps prior user's org during contamination window; feature gates run with wrong entitlement. Silent — no console error. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-02** — `interval: "unknown"` for all Pro accounts; `currentPeriodEnd: null`. UI cannot show Monthly/Annual or renewal date. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-03** — `portalAvailable: false` for test2 and test4. Paying subscribers cannot open Stripe portal from within the app. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-04** — `workspaceCount: 7` inflated for test4 due to orphaned `org_member` rows. Workspace limit enforcement is wrong for that account. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-05** — test6's second workspace absent from UI switcher despite valid billing-status. Membership row passes billing-status auth but fails another query. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-06** — "Manage" billing navigates current tab to `billing.stripe.com` instead of opening a new tab. Destroys app session. | QA report 2026-05-04 |
| ⚠️ | **BUG-07** — Sidebar upgrade element retains stale cross-user billing content after sign-in. Hidden visually (`display:none` on parent), but innerHTML is wrong. Any parent-wrapper regression would expose it. | QA report 2026-05-04 |

### 1E — Account Deletion & Security
| Status | Item | Evidence |
|--------|------|----------|
| ✅ | Delete account blocked if user is last Owner of any org | Code + UI message |
| ✅ | `deletion_status = 'requested'` is authoritative login block | Phase 0.6D-pre |
| ✅ | `request-account-deletion` preserves `organization_members` during 30-day window | Code |
| ✅ | Legacy `delete-account`, `ban-user`, `unban-user` Edge Functions retired (410) | Deployed |
| ✅ | Admin cannot remove another Admin (server + RLS) | Migration `2026050702` + deployed |
| ✅ | `billing-status` returns `billing_unavailable` for archived resolved workspaces | Code |
| ✅ | Support-assisted `cancel-account-deletion` endpoint deployed | Live curl 200 |
| ✅ | **P0 — `profiles` deletion fields server-side guard deployed and live-verified.** Main commit `e8c0b3f` introduced `supabase/migrations/2026061301_guard_profile_deletion_fields.sql`. Remote migration history on `yduzbvijzwczjapanxbd` includes `2026061301_guard_profile_deletion_fields`. Catalog verification on 2026-06-14 found one enabled `BEFORE UPDATE` row trigger on `public.profiles` (`tp3d_profiles_guard_deletion_fields`) calling `public.tp3d_guard_profile_deletion_fields()`, PL/pgSQL, SECURITY INVOKER, locked `search_path = ''`, NULL-safe `is not distinct from` checks for `deletion_status`/`deleted_at`/`purge_after`, 42501 rejection, no `session_user`/metadata/email/auth.uid bypass, and no duplicate deletion-field trigger. `anon`, `authenticated`, and `public` have no direct EXECUTE privilege. Live rollback-only DB behavior used the disposable `test5` fixture (no Stripe customer rows, no subscription rows; no real customer data): authenticated role updates to each protected field and a combined protected update were rejected with SQLSTATE 42501; normal profile update succeeded; unchanged protected values succeeded through the fast path; service-role protected update succeeded; original values were restored and rechecked (`deletion_status=none`, `deleted_at=null`, `purge_after=null`, `bio=null`). No auth user was deleted and no purge ran. Edge request/cancel source remains service-role based, but live request/cancel flow was not run because no no-workspace disposable account exists in the visible fixtures. | Live SQL verification + static invariant tests; 2026-06-14 |
| ✅ | Add targeted tests/proof: non-service-role calls cannot mutate `profiles.deletion_status`, `deleted_at`, `purge_after` — 8 static migration/invariant tests cover trigger/function structure, NULL-safe comparisons, fast-path, 42501 raise, trusted role model, no owner/admin/member/metadata bypass, SECURITY INVOKER + locked search path, EXECUTE revokes, Edge Function service clients, and browser client block. Live DB rollback proof on 2026-06-14 confirmed authenticated 42501 rejection for all protected fields and combined updates, normal update success, unchanged-value fast-path success, service-role success, and restoration. | `tests/audit/security-and-invariants.spec.mjs` + live SQL verification |
| ❓ | Define paid-subscription deletion policy: must cancel first, or support-assisted cancel during delete flow | — |
| ⬜ | Verify Admin cannot remove Admin in live browser | — |
| ⬜ | Verify Admin can still remove Member in live browser | — |
| ⬜ | Rotate Supabase DB password (was pasted in terminal/chat history during setup) | — |
| ⬜ | `purge-deleted-accounts` scheduling: pg_cron unavailable; decide GitHub Actions cron, external scheduler, or manual support runs (operational checklist item, not a code defect) | — |

### 1F — Feature Gating
| Status | Item | Evidence |
|--------|------|----------|
| ✅ | AutoPack gate respects trial, trial-expired, past-due, workspace-limit-reached | Browser verified |
| ✅ | PDF export gate respects same billing states | Browser verified |
| ✅ | Trial-expired: owner gets Subscribe CTA, non-owner gets support message | Browser verified test3 |
| ✅ | Workspace-limit-reached: AutoPack + PDF blocked with correct message | Browser verified fixture |
| ⬜ | Every Pro-gated feature checks billing-status at **action time**, not only at render | — |
| ⬜ | Backend enforcement (Edge Functions / RLS) for sensitive gated operations | — |
| ⬜ | Free users hitting gated actions see upgrade CTA, not broken/blank state | — |
| ❓ | Define policy: downgraded orgs keep existing packs read-only or with creation limits | — |
| ⬜ | Export (JSON backup) always works regardless of plan — data portability guarantee | — |

## PART 2 — PLATFORM SAFETY (Must-Have Before Growth)

### 2A — Runtime Error States
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | 404 for unknown hash routes |
| ⬜ | 404 / graceful fallback for missing/deleted current pack while editor is active |
| ⬜ | Fatal runtime error overlay (`#error-overlay` + `src/ui/error-overlay.js`) |
| ⬜ | Maintenance mode via inline config (blocks app boot before `src/app.js` loads) |
| ⬜ | Pre-boot vendor/CDN failure fallback with one-shot guard |
| ⬜ | Keep `system-overlay` intact — do not mix runtime safety into modularization |

### 2B — Data Export / Import
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | Workspace JSON Export MVP (Settings → General, owner/admin-gated) |
| ✅ | Export includes packs, cases/items, `folderLibrary`; strips thumbnails |
| ✅ | Export excludes Stripe IDs, JWTs, service keys, private tokens, raw org/user IDs |
| ✅ | `parseWorkspaceImportJSON()` exists as groundwork |
| ✅ | Case Library spreadsheet imports capped at 5,000 rows and 10 MB |
| 🔄 | Workspace Export browser sign-off: owner/admin/member visibility; inspect downloaded file |
| 🟡 | **localStorage scale risk — thumbnails stored inline.** `saveNow()` writes full `caseLibrary` and `packLibrary` into workspace-scoped localStorage. Pack thumbnails are stored inline after preview capture. A single large workspace can exhaust the ~5 MB quota. Fix options: strip thumbnails from autosave payload (re-capture on demand), add quota check + warning before write, or move large payloads to IndexedDB. |
| ⚠️ | **JSON import has no file-size gate.** Spreadsheet imports are capped (5,000 rows / 10 MB) but JSON import parse paths have no comparable limit. A very large or malformed JSON file could hang or crash the tab. Add a file-size check before parsing. |
| ⬜ | Add localStorage quota handling: detect approaching limit and warn user before write fails |
| ⬜ | Add JSON import file-size limit (consistent with spreadsheet cap) |
| ⬜ | Workspace Import UI (decide under which roles; parser groundwork already exists) |
| ⬜ | App Export covers preferences + local libraries (full local backup path) |
| ⬜ | Export for member/invite summary (deferred — requires server reads + role decisions) |

### 2C — Security Hardening
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| 🟡 | **Composite DB indexes missing for common billing queries.** Current `subscriptions` table has only single-column indexes. Portal and billing-status queries filter on `(organization_id, status, updated_at)` and `(stripe_customer_id, status, updated_at)`. Add composite indexes before scale. |
| 🟡 | **Multi-workspace billing fallbacks need hardening.** Owner-account entitlement can fall back to the oldest owner workspace when no mapping is found (`billing-status/index.ts`). Portal lookup can fall back by customer without an org filter (`stripe-create-portal-session/index.ts`). Both paths need integration tests and explicit guards before paid scale. |
| ⬜ | Integration test: portal preselection always targets the correct workspace subscription for a multi-workspace owner |
| ⬜ | Integration test: owner-account entitlement fallback does not bleed entitlement across workspaces |
| ⬜ | Make Edge Function error responses less raw — checkout and portal currently return raw exception messages to the client; sanitize to safe user-facing copy |
| ⬜ | Content Security Policy headers on all pages |
| ⬜ | CORS policy: allow only your domain(s) to call Edge Functions |
| ⬜ | Input sanitization: all user text fields escaped before rendering |
| ⬜ | Rate limiting: login, signup, password reset, billing actions, invite sending |
| ⬜ | JWT validation on all Edge Functions (not only billing) |
| ⬜ | No secrets, JWTs, or API keys logged to console in production flows |

## PART 3 — CODE ARCHITECTURE & CLEANUP

### 3A — App Modularization
*Do not split `app.js` until after the AutoPack Core Engine epic is merged. The first step is M0 inventory of globals, storage keys, BroadcastChannels, custom events, and exported surfaces. Do Phase B and C only after release gate is green.*

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **M0 — Inventory first after AutoPack epic merge**: Create written inventory of all app globals, storage keys, BroadcastChannels, custom events, and exported surfaces before splitting `src/app.js` |
| ⬜ | **M0**: Write focused tests for `getProRuleSet()` before extracting it |
| ⬜ | **Phase A — low risk, do first**: Extract `AccountSwitcher` from `src/app.js` → `src/ui/account-switcher.js`. It is self-contained with its own unmount path. Validate: account menu, workspace switch, settings, logout. |
| ⬜ | **Phase A — medium-low risk**: Extract `TrailerGeometry` from `src/app.js` → `src/services/trailer-geometry.js`, but ONLY after tolerance is unified (see 3B). Validate: rect, wheel wells, front bonus, AutoPack. |
| ⬜ | **Phase B**: Extract `ExportService` as a dependency-injected factory. Validate: screenshots, PDF billing gate, preview capture workspace guard. |
| ⬜ | **Phase B**: Extract `KeyboardManager`, keeping same shortcuts + adding teardown, only after tests exist. |
| ⬜ | **Phase C (later — high risk)**: Billing state / cross-tab / access gate extraction. Validate cross-tab, sign-out, org switch, stale billing, autosave before touching. |
| ⬜ | **Phase C (later — high risk)**: Org/workspace switching extraction. Same validation requirements. |
| ⬜ | Replace manually hardcoded build stamp in `src/app.js` with an automated or build-generated value. Do not record a fixed expected HEAD hash anywhere in this TODO. |
| ⬜ | Split `settings-overlay.js` by concern (deferred until workspace + runtime safety are stable) |
| ⬜ | Settings → Workspace → General: reorganize into 4 cards per approved UI plan (Identity, Backup & Export, Ownership & Access, Danger Zone) |

### 3B — Geometry & Engine Cleanup
*Fix epsilon before any Phase A extraction and before any deeper placement-phase work.*

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| 🔄 | **Unify trailer geometry tolerance — technical blocker for placement work.** Implemented the canonical inch-space containment contract on `fix/3b-geometry-tolerance-unification`: `pack-library.js` now exports `CONTAINMENT_EPS_INCHES = 0.05`; `autopack-solver.js` and `app.js` reference that shared constant; editor drag feedback now converts the world-space object AABB to inches and passes inch-space usable zones instead of converting zones to world. Automated validation completed with targeted 3B tests passing (4/4), full audit suite passing (532/532), lint zero errors (existing warnings only), typecheck passing, and diff whitespace checks passing. **In-browser logic verification 2026-06-17** (Chromium via Playwright, real shipped modules over a local static server, no auth): the app boots with **0 page errors / 0 console errors** (only 2 benign headless-WebGL GPU-stall perf warnings); `CONTAINMENT_EPS_INCHES` reads `0.05` live; and `pack-library.getTrailerUsableZones` + `isAabbContainedInAnyZone` give the correct canonical 0.05" verdicts for all three modes — Standard (on-boundary accepted, 0.04" outside accepted, 0.06" outside rejected, 0.06" below-floor rejected), Wheel Wells (inside blocked well staged, above-well accepted, center-corridor accepted), Front Overhang (deck accepted, cab-void rejected, seam-crossing staged, main-box accepted). **Still 🔄 — interactive editor checks remain** (need a signed-in session driving the 3D canvas): live drag inside/outside feedback agreeing with the saved drop for the same final position (exercises `editor-screen.isInsideTruck` world→inch path, not reachable headless), rotate/flip, collision rejection, and Stats / out-of-gauge agreement. See "Remaining manual editor checklist" below. |
| ⬜ | After tolerance is unified: consolidate `TrailerGeometry` into a single canonical module (currently duplicated between `app.js` and `pack-library.js`) |
| 🔄 | `solveLegacyAutoPack()` — epic audit confirmed it is not used by normal production AutoPack, but do not delete it until live item prep is extracted and tests are updated |
| ⬜ | Move live `buildLegacyAutoPackItems()` into a new `src/services/autopack-item-builder.js` module with a compatibility re-export; update `autopack-engine.js` and invariant tests before trimming legacy files |
| ⬜ | After the item-builder extraction is validated: trim `autopack-legacy-solver.js` only after `rg solveLegacyAutoPack` shows zero production references |
| ⬜ | Future only after merge + item-builder cleanup: split `autopack-solver.js` by responsibility (placement search, scoring, phase sequencing, recovery/repair), one narrow branch at a time |

#### Remaining manual editor checklist (3B + 5A — signed-in session, one pack per truck mode)
*The headless run above proved the containment math and the solver contract in a real browser; these steps cover the interactive UX that needs a human at the 3D canvas. Enable `localStorage.tp3dDebug = "1"` for extra logging. Do not commit any browser-only debug code.*
- **3B — each of Standard / Wheel Wells / Front Overhang:** open an existing pack; confirm cases render in place, drag is smooth, rotate/flip work, collision rejection works, no new console errors. Drag a case to a valid boundary and confirm the live "inside" feedback matches the saved placement after drop (no inside-during-drag → staged-after-drop flip for the same final position). Nudge ~0.04" past a wall → still accepted; ~0.06" past → rejected/staged. Confirm Stats, placement state, drag feedback, and out-of-gauge warnings agree.
- **3B — Wheel Wells:** a case cannot be dropped into a blocked wheel-well volume; a case beside/above the well places when valid; no case overlaps the blocked zones.
- **5Q — Wheel Wells quality follow-up:** browser spot-check `fix/wheelwell-floor-channel-compaction` / `f680679` with simple cartons and mixed loads. Confirm channel rows stay aligned, lower/front/channel positions fill before raised shelf use, keyboard duplicate/copy-paste does not create collisions, black case face labels are visible, and any remaining raised shelf/bridge gaps are physically explainable rather than solver-skipped. This is subject to more testing, but the current result is acceptable to move on.
- **3B — Front Overhang:** a case sits on the raised deck only when its full footprint+height fit; the cab void below the deck rejects placement; a case straddling the main-box/overhang seam classifies correctly (staged unless it fits one zone).
- **5A — each mode:** run AutoPack on a pack containing a `noStackOnTop` case, a `stackable:false` case, and a `maxStackCount`-limited case (now settable in the Case modal Handling Rules section, or via preset/import). Confirm: nothing rests on the `noStackOnTop`/`stackable:false` cases; the `maxStackCount` base shows at most that many direct children; lower layers fill before higher ones; no overlaps, no out-of-bounds, no floating items; staged count is reasonable; front-first ordering holds; console has no new errors.

### 3C — Test Quality
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Add live integration tests (currently only audit/static checks exist)**: checkout owner/member denial, portal wrong-workspace preselection, webhook out-of-order + idempotent replay, billing-status after workspace switch, expired invite, accepted-invite same-email guard, account deletion owner block, RLS member/non-member select denial, import/export large-workspace quota |
| ✅ | Add test/proof: non-service-role calls cannot mutate `profiles.deletion_status`, `deleted_at`, `purge_after` — static migration/invariant tests exist in `security-and-invariants.spec.mjs`; live DB rollback verification completed 2026-06-14 against `yduzbvijzwczjapanxbd` with authenticated 42501 rejections and service-role success |
| ⬜ | Add regression test for `interval` and `currentPeriodEnd` returned by `/billing-status` for all Pro states |
| ⬜ | Add stress-test coverage for 200+ case loads (performance + correctness) |
| ⬜ | Reduce regex-heavy audit tests gradually; replace with direct behavior tests |
| ✅ | Phase tests are based on source ownership/behavior, not live working-tree file lists. `8474b09` retired ALL remaining `git diff`-based "changed files stay inside scope" guards (−804 lines in `security-and-invariants.spec.mjs`), following the earlier removal of the G1.2B/G1.2C/G1.2D polish-phase guards (they false-failed on any later valid change to forbidden files such as `autopack-engine.js`). No working-tree/`git diff --name-only` scope guards remain in `tests/`. Behavior/source-ownership tests retained; suite green (529). |

### 3D — Code Quality
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | `npm run lint` passes with warnings only on `epic/autopack-core-engine` at `817a5bc`; warnings remain cleanup debt, not the current merge blocker |
| ⬜ | Formatting-only branch for the existing 87-file `format:check` drift; do not auto-format the AutoPack Core Engine epic |
| 🔄 | Fix remaining eslint warnings (unused vars, no-use-before-define) — no behavior changes |
| 🔄 | Replace browser-native `window.prompt`/`alert` in app flows with app UI modal patterns |
| ⬜ | Fix html-validate warnings (prefer native button) in highest-impact UI first |
| ⬜ | Remove dead code after confirming no callers |

## PART 4 — UI / UX

### 4A — Inspector Panel
*Active work: G1.2C. Do not change Transform, Rotate, Flip, visibility, duplicate, delete, or selection behavior.*

| 🔄 | G1.2C: Actions card inline layout styles removed — implemented, awaiting manual browser review |
| 🔄 | G1.2C: Usable overhang height display (trailer height minus deck height) — implemented, awaiting manual browser review |
| ⚠️ | **Inspector help tooltips use fragile positioning — affects all Inspector cards.** Confirmed broken on Transform and Front Overhang. Tooltips cover unrelated fields, extend over the card below, are too wide for the Inspector panel, do not choose direction based on available space, and may be clipped or hard to close on smaller screens. All Inspector help tooltips (Truck, Front Overhang, Wheel Wells, Transform, Rotate/Flip, and any others) must anchor to their own card header, remain fully inside the viewport, and automatically flip left/right or above/below based on available space. Tooltip placement must never depend on the card's computed height. |

| ⬜ | Tooltip never extends outside the browser viewport at any size |
| ⬜ | Tooltip does not cover its own card's main fields when another placement is available |

## PART 5 — AUTOPACK ENGINE

### Dependency order for AutoPack work
1. Front-first default fix (A1.1B) — ✅ merged (`4fc8821`)
2. Geometry epsilon unification (3B) — ✅ merged (`33b362a`)
3. noStackOnTop / `stackable:false` / maxStackCount enforcement — ✅ audited: already enforced in the active solver; runtime tests added (see 5A)
4. Stacking score correction — ✅ audited: the alleged flat `STACKING_BONUS` does not exist; active scoring is lexicographic and lower-first (see 5A)
5. Full A1 realism and compaction audit — next, after 5A browser spot-check

### 5Q — Current AutoPack Quality / Performance / Operation Queue (2026-06-24)
| Status | Item | Evidence / Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|
| 🔄 | **E1 — Standard/Wheel Wells layer and stack quality** | Local branch `fix/autopack-layer-quality-e1`, SHA `b1be932`; improves same-case stack orientation/layer-follow and increases placement in Standard/Wheel Wells stress tests. Not merged unless included through E2B stack. |
| 🔄 | **E2A — Floor/lane/filler layout quality outside Front Overhang** | Local branch `fix/autopack-floor-quality-e2a`, SHA `ee566add`; fixes scorer gate for ordinary floor/lane/filler paths; safe and surgical, but large Wheel Wells loads still dominated by repeated-grid/channel behavior. |
| 🔄 | **E2B — Wheel Wells channel block + contiguous filler stack-follow** | Local branch `fix/autopack-wheelwells-channel-e2b`, SHA `fa4f9c7`; keeps valid channel filler, organizes stack layers to follow the channel footprint, placement non-decreasing, Wheel Wells 800 improves 701→706, Standard/Front Overhang unchanged. Awaiting final validation/merge decision. |
| 🔄 | **Large-load snap performance / animation safety** | Local branch `fix/autopack-large-load-animation-safety`, SHA `05f56f4`; loads with more than 300 packed placements snap to final placement, bypass long row-aware animation, and write final state before animation. Automated validation is green, but manual UX still shows a silent synchronous wait. |
| 🔄 | **Operation UX + concurrency control stack** | Branch `fix/editor-operation-lifecycle-ux` validated locally: `714/714` tests, lint `0 errors` with existing warnings only. Practical merge dependency before Wheel-well foundation because the Wheel-well branch is stacked on it. |
| ✅ | **Wheel-well support/stability foundation + front/channel quality pass** | Branch stack pushed through `fix/wheelwell-floor-channel-compaction`; latest commit `f680679` aligns Wheel Wells channel lanes. Included related commits: `2b2167c` front-compress wheel-well placements, `eaba2c1` safe keyboard duplicate/copy-paste placement, `c23e627` floor/channel compaction, `ca75c83` black case face labels, `d4ba11b` raised-support fill ordering, and `f680679` channel lane alignment. Browser spot-check shows the Wheel Wells result is much cleaner and acceptable to move on, but still subject to more visual testing before final product sign-off. Automated validation reported by Codex/Claude: focused Wheel Wells tests green, full audit suite green (`748/748` after lane-alignment patch), typecheck clean, lint `0 errors` with pre-existing warnings only, and diff checks clean. Remaining raised shelf/bridge gaps are deferred to a future explicit bridge/spanning strategy, not this packet. |
| ✅ | **Wheel-well manual movement blocked-body defect** | Fixed and tested before the floor/channel quality stack. Manual movement no longer permits cases to pass through or into wheel-well blocked body volumes. Keep browser regression checks in the manual editor checklist, but this is no longer the active blocker. |
| ⬜ | **Wheel-well bridge/spanning strategy** | Future branch. The current Wheel Wells stack intentionally avoids faking support and does not force cartons into physically unsupported raised shelf gaps. Build true bridge/spanning only with an explicit product contract, real coplanar/support checks, browser fixtures, and tests across different carton sizes. |
| ⬜ | **Front Overhang wall-building strategy** | C2 safety gate exists; solver still needs to intentionally build retaining wall then load the deck. |
| ⬜ | **Manual vertical placement / snap-on-top** | User can choose a box, move it up/down, snap onto a valid support, and leave it if all hard rules pass. Requires editor interaction, support validation, collision feedback, and undo/redo. |
| ⬜ | **Organized Unpack** | Unpack should generate grouped staging rows/blocks instead of scattered layout. |

### 5A — Near-Term Correctness Fixes
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | **A1.1B — default packing direction** — Merged (`4fc8821`) and browser-verified 2026-06-14. Changed `const loadFrontFirst = mode === 'frontBonus'` → `const loadFrontFirst = true` in `src/services/autopack-engine.js` so all three modes pack front-first. Engine-only change; `loadFrontFirst` only affects placement ordering/anchoring (zones resolved separately, so containment/blocked zones unchanged). Added source-ownership test in `tests/audit/security-and-invariants.spec.mjs`; suite green, lint 0 errors, typecheck clean. |
| ✅ | Standard packs front-first — engine default now `true` (mode `rect`); browser-verified 2026-06-14 |
| ✅ | Wheel Wells packs front-first while respecting wheel-well zones — engine default now `true` (mode `wheelWells`); blocked zones come from `getTrailerUsableZones` and are unaffected by direction; browser-verified 2026-06-14 |
| ✅ | Front Overhang remains front-first and cab-void safe (no change needed) — already front-first; behavior unchanged |
| 🔄 | **`noStackOnTop` / `stackable: false` — already enforced in the ACTIVE solver (audit corrected the diagnosis).** Audit on branch `fix/5a-autopack-stacking-safety` (base `33b362a`) found the cited `findRestingY()` / `collides()` live only in the RETIRED legacy solver (`solveLegacyAutoPack`, no production caller), not the active path. The active solver (`autopack-solver.js` → `solveAutoPack`) blocks both flags on the support side via the shared `canSupportStack` / `supportsCandidate` checks at every stacking entry point (floor/filler/stack/repack — `findStackPlacement` is the only function that lifts an item) and re-checks them in `validatePackedPlacements`. Direct solver probes confirm: nothing rests on a `noStackOnTop` base even through filler/repack and merged supports. Confirmed product meaning: both flags mean "nothing may rest on this item" (support-side); a flagged item may itself still sit on a sturdy support — this matches the pre-existing committed test `AUTO-PACK-A1-R4 … honors noStackOnTop and stackable false`. Locked with new runtime regression tests (`5A …`). **In-browser logic verification 2026-06-17** (Chromium, shipped `solveAutoPack`): a `noStackOnTop` floor base received **0** children through floor/filler/repack. Remaining: interactive live-AutoPack spot-check (see checklist under 3B). |
| 🔄 | **`maxStackCount` — already enforced in the ACTIVE solver** as a per-support **direct-children** cap (`getMaxStackCount` → `countDirectStackChildren` → `hasStackCapacity`), checked in `findStackPlacement` and re-checked in `validatePackedPlacements`. `0` = unlimited (by design; `noStackOnTop` is the "nothing on top" flag). It is intentionally NOT a global tower-height cap: a child placed on a child is governed by that child's own `maxStackCount`. Direct probes confirm exact boundaries for 0 / 1 / 2 and multi-layer towers with no bypass. Locked with new runtime tests. **In-browser logic verification 2026-06-17** (Chromium, shipped `solveAutoPack`): a `maxStackCount: 2` base capped at exactly **2** direct children (4 total placed), and stacking filled the lower layer first. Remaining: interactive live-AutoPack spot-check (see checklist under 3B). If product wants a total-tower-height cap, that is a separate future change (see ❓ below). |
| ✅ | **Scoring "STACKING_BONUS" bug does not exist in the active solver — original text was inaccurate.** There is no `STACKING_BONUS` constant or additive height/gravity penalty anywhere in `autopack-solver.js` (nor the legacy solver). The active solver scores candidates with **lexicographic tuples** whose first key is `aabb.min.y`, so lower/safer placements always win and lower layers fill before higher ones; no flat bonus can cancel a height preference. Verified by runtime test `5A stacking prefers the lower layer before opening a higher layer`. No code change required. |
| ❓ | **Decision needed — should `stackable: false` also block the item from being placed ON TOP of another (child-side)?** Today `stackable:false` and `noStackOnTop` are support-side synonyms; a `stackable:false` item can still be stacked as a child when it cannot floor-fit (this is the behavior the committed tests assert). A "not stackable ⇒ stays on the floor / unpacked" reading would be strictly safer but is a product-meaning change. Not changed in this pass per scope rules — awaiting product decision before any solver change. |

### 5B — Deep AutoPack Realism Review (Phase A1)
*Do not start until 5A correctness fixes and 3B epsilon unification are complete.*

**2026-06-23 update:** the current realism work is no longer a single broad 5B phase. It has been split into focused E-phases above. Do not run a broad AutoPack rewrite. Keep fixes scoped: E2B quality stack, then performance, then wheel-well bridge support, then Front Overhang wall-building.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | Wheel Wells quality stack — pushed on `fix/wheelwell-floor-channel-compaction` through `f680679`; good enough to move on, but subject to more browser testing before final product sign-off | Covers front compression, safe keyboard duplicate/copy-paste placement, floor/channel compaction, raised-support ordering, black case face labels, and channel lane anti-zigzag. Remaining Wheel Wells shelf/bridge gaps require future explicit bridge/spanning strategy, not more quick compaction tweaks. |
| ⚠️ | Large-load AutoPack animation/performance: skip/cap animation and commit final state safely before or independent of long animation | |
| ⬜ | Wheel-well bridge/spanning support: future explicit bridge contract for true raised/well-top use across different box sizes; do not fake full-width raised floor or bypass support/span constraints | |
| ⬜ | Front Overhang wall-building strategy: build retaining wall first, then fill retained raised deck | |
| ⬜ | Review scoring order and candidate selection | |
| ⬜ | Review repeated floor batches | |
| ⬜ | Review heavy-on-bottom behavior | |
| ⬜ | Review fragile-item protection (fragile flag → top layer only) | |
| ⬜ | Review support-area requirements | |
| ⬜ | Review max stack height enforcement | |
| ⬜ | Review orientation constraints | |
| ⬜ | Review weight distribution | |
| ⬜ | Review axle-zone balancing | |
| ⬜ | CoG as a penalty in AutoPack scoring (cross-ref: 6C) | |
| ⬜ | Produce multiple valid packing results (like TruckPacker's 5 parallel algorithms) | |
| ⬜ | Keep deterministic output where required | |
| ⬜ | Verify Standard, Wheel Wells, Front Overhang, containers, and future space types | |
| ⬜ | Replace weak source-pattern tests with runtime behavior tests | |

### 5C — AutoPack Strategy Controls (Future)
*Keep strategy IDs out of schema until 5A and 5B are stable.*

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Front-first as default (see 6L for persistence) |
| ⬜ | Rear-first as user option |
| ⬜ | Balanced/COG-aware option (cross-ref: 6C) |
| ⬜ | Per-pack AutoPack strategy setting |
| ⬜ | Per-run strategy override |
| ⬜ | Strategy IDs: `frontFirst`, `rearFirst`, `balancedCog`, `multiStop`, `zoneSequence` |
| ⬜ | Packs with no saved strategy fall back to front-first (no migration needed) |

### 5D — Multi-Stop & Load Order (Future)
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Pack-level delivery stops/groups |
| ⬜ | Load phases + unload sequence |
| ⬜ | Zone sequence support |
| ⬜ | First-in/last-out and last-in/first-out rules |
| ⬜ | Support `loadPriority`, `mustLoadLast`, `mustUnloadFirst`, `stopGroup`, `keepTogetherGroup`, `deliverySequence` |
| ⬜ | Visual stop colors or grouping |
| ⬜ | Stop-aware manifests and load instructions in PDF/export |

## PART 6 — PRODUCT FEATURES (Competitive Parity)

### 6A — Quick Product Wins (After AutoPack correctness fixes)
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | **Weight View**: toggle — color-codes placed boxes green→yellow→red by relative weight |
| ⬜ | **Weight Scale panel**: Current / Capacity / Remaining / Excess / % |
| ⬜ | **PDF improvements**: front view, category color chips, page numbers, payload line in header, branded org header |

### 6B — Cargo Constraints (Competitive Parity)
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| 🔄 | Stackability per case: `noStackOnTop` + `maxStackCount` — **already solver-enforced; now exposed in the Case modal, shown across cards/list/Browser/Inspector, and CSV/XLSX-importable (Cargo-Rule V1, `957b5eb`/`c5e5c56`/`e9ebb8a`)**. Remaining: browser sign-off. (Raw `stackable` stays internal; `noStackOnTop` is the user-facing rule.) |
| ⬜ | `"With Like"` stacking: only same case preset ID can stack on each other (future) |
| 🔄 | Orientation lock: Any / Keep upright / Place on side — **modal control + canonical `onSide` + solver correctness fix shipped (Cargo-Rule V1, `c0fe57d`/`957b5eb`)**. Remaining: browser sign-off |
| 🔄 | Do-not-stack flag (`noStackOnTop`, hard block in AutoPack) — **shipped in Cargo-Rule V1**; remaining: browser sign-off |
| 🚫 | Fragile flag — **deferred**: not a single flag. "Auto-places on top layer" + "not buried" + higher per-item support fraction require new solver scoring/phase; must not ship a broad "Fragile" checkbox that only sets `noStackOnTop`. Future solver work. |
| ⬜ | Allowed rotations per case (subset of 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) |
| ⬜ | Shipment grouping: items in same group stay together in container |

### 6C — Center of Gravity (CoG)
*CoG display toggle lives in 6J. CoG as AutoPack penalty lives in 5B.*

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | CoG calculation service — weighted average of all placed items |
| ⬜ | Live CoG indicator in 3D viewport (sphere/crosshair, green/yellow/red) |
| ⬜ | CoG deviation % in stats panel (front/rear, left/right) |
| ⬜ | "Within 10% of center" tolerance check with pass/fail badge |

### 6D — Non-Box Shapes & OOG
| Status | Item |

| ⬜ | Out-of-gauge (OOG): detect items extending beyond container boundary |
| ⬜ | Classify OOG violations: over-length, over-width, over-height |
| ⬜ | Visual OOG indicator: red/orange highlight on protruding portion |
| ⬜ | "Permit required" badge for OOG items |
| ⬜ | Optional: flatbed trailer preset (no walls) for OOG loads |

### 6E — Spaces & Equipment Library (Data Model)

**Data model direction (long-term):**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Introduce `space` as the top-level concept: `spaceType`, `spaceProfile`, `usableZones`, `blockedZones`, `accessPoints` |
| ⬜ | A truck becomes one `spaceType` within the space model, not the root concept |

| ⬜ | Standard road vehicle presets: vans, box trucks, trailers, flatbeds (Standard / Wheel Wells / Front Overhang) |
| ⬜ | Standard shipping container presets: 20ft, 40ft, 40ftHC, open top, flat rack |
| ⬜ | Portable storage container presets: PODS, U-Haul U-Box, 1-800-PACK-RAT, and generic 8×8×16 |

### 6I — Data & Stats Definitions
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Define truck volume capacity formally per shape |
| ⬜ | Front Overhang: main-body volume + raised-overhang volume; exclude cab void |
| ⬜ | Wheel Wells: subtract blocked well volume |
| ⬜ | One clear definition of "Volume used" across UI, exports, and reports |
| ⬜ | Add packed cubic feet/meters only after calculation is trusted |
| ⬜ | Add weight capacity only after truck presets include max payload |

### 6L — Settings & Preferences
*This section covers persistence only. The feature itself is listed in its primary section.*

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Persist user's default AutoPack strategy preference (cross-ref: 5C) |
| ⬜ | Persist each Editor Display toggle (cross-ref: 6J) |
| ⬜ | Unit system preference (metric vs imperial) — confirm current implementation is complete |
| ⬜ | Normalization and fallback values for all new preferences |
| ⬜ | Test preference persistence across reloads |

### 6M — Server-Backed Packs/Cases (Future Milestone)
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Audit current local Pack/Case/Folder model and decide migration timing |
| ⬜ | Design server tables with `organization_id`, `created_by`, timestamps, role-aware RLS |
| ⬜ | Plan local draft/autosave behavior after server persistence exists |
| ⬜ | Plan migration from local workspace data to server data |
| ⬜ | Keep local export/import as backup even after server persistence |
| ⬜ | Cross-device sync |
| ⬜ | Server-side pagination and search (current implementation sorts/filters full in-memory arrays before pagination — fails at scale) |
| ⬜ | Object storage for pack preview thumbnails and assets (removes thumbnails from localStorage payload) |
| ⬜ | Webhook failure dashboard using `webhook_events.status` indexes |
| 🟡 | Scale readiness: 10 clients = 7/10 (viable with integration tests); 100 clients = 5/10 (localStorage limits, full-array render, billing fallback ambiguity); 1,000 clients = 2/10 without server-backed data, server pagination, and monitoring |

### 6N — Storage Space Planning & Comparison
*This is the consumer and moving/storage vertical. The same 3D engine that plans truck loads also answers: "Will my sofa, bed, boxes, and appliances fit in a 10×10 storage unit, a PODS container, or a garage condo?" This is a distinct product use case that needs its own items, starter content, and UI mode.*

**Item and space starter libraries:**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Furniture and household item starter library (sofa, bed, dresser, refrigerator, washer/dryer, boxes, etc.) |
| ⬜ | Self-storage unit presets: 5×5, 5×10, 10×10, 10×15, 10×20, 10×30 (cross-ref 6E) |
| ⬜ | Garage condo preset templates |
| ⬜ | Residential garage templates (1-car, 2-car, with door and column positions) |
| ⬜ | Portable storage container templates: PODS 8×8×16, 8×8×12, generic sizes |

**Space comparison workflow:**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | User selects an item list and compares it across several spaces in one view |
| ⬜ | Fit result shown for every compared space (fits / does not fit / partially fits) |
| ⬜ | Packed volume, remaining volume, floor usage, and blocked items per space |
| ⬜ | Recommend the smallest space that safely fits all selected items |
| ⬜ | Show which items do not fit in a given space and why |
| ⬜ | Compare alternative layouts within the same space |
| ⬜ | Optional rental price input per space for cost comparison |
| ⬜ | "Best value" ranking combining fit, remaining space, and price |

**Space constraints (storage-specific):**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | Support doors, columns, stairs, sloped ceilings, shelving, and fixed obstacle zones |
| ⬜ | Access-path clearance: items placed near the door must remain reachable (not trapped behind others) |
| ⬜ | Loading sequence that respects access order (last-in/first-out for storage) |
| ⬜ | Wall-hugging behavior for large items (sofas, appliances along walls first) |

**Output and sharing:**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | "Room view" mode that does not look like a truck (no rail colors, no cab markers) |
| ⬜ | Storage layout, item manifest, and moving/loading order export |
| ⬜ | Customer-facing shared results link for storage companies and garage-condo sellers |
| ⬜ | Branded output for storage facility or moving company clients |

**Data model alignment:**
| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| ⬜ | `spaceType: 'storage'` distinguishes storage spaces from road vehicles in the data model |
| ⬜ | Solver respects access-point geometry (door position, door width) when ordering items |
| ⬜ | No truck-specific fields (wheel wells, cab void, axle zones) appear in the storage UI |
| ⬜ | AutoPack strategy for storage: wall-first, then center fill, then vertical stacking |

## Execution Rules
1. **One phase at a time.** No mixing billing fixes with product feature work.
2. **Audit before implementation.** Confirm real reproduced bugs before writing code.
3. **Validate before merging.** `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run -s typecheck`, `git diff --check`, browser checks.
4. **Keep changes small and testable.** If a task touches auth/billing/orgs/roles, treat as P0 risk.
5. **Update this file after each completed phase.** This is the single source of truth.
6. **Proof before marking ✅.** Add evidence to release-gate rows. A plain checkmark on a billing/security item is not enough months later.
