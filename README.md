- **Hardened Imports**: npm-owned Three.js/OrbitControls runtime and sanitized JSON imports

## Quick Start

1. **Use the supported Node toolchain**: Node `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0` (the Vite 8 requirement).
2. **Install reproducibly**: Run `npm ci`.
3. **Start development**: Run `npm run dev`.
4. **Open the app**: Visit `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.
5. **Create a pack**: Click "New Pack" on the Packs screen.
6. **Add cases**: Go to Cases library and create equipment cases with dimensions.
7. **Start packing**: Open your pack in the Editor and drag cases from the sidebar to the 3D truck.
8. **Export**: Save your work as JSON or export to PDF/Excel for sharing.

## Development and Production Builds

Three.js is pinned to r185 (`0.185.1`) and delivered through npm and Vite. Three.js and OrbitControls
are bundled into application-owned production assets; the running app does not depend on a
third-party Three.js CDN.

- `npm ci` installs the exact dependency graph from `package-lock.json`.
- `npm run dev` starts Vite at `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.
- `npm run build` creates the static production output in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the built output at `http://localhost:5500/index.html` after the
  development server is stopped.

The `dist/` directory is a static deployment artifact. No application server or server-side
rendering runtime is required.

## Phase 1 (SaaS-Ready Foundation)

Phase 1 introduces a session/org foundation, plan/role-aware feature flags, and hash routing. See
`docs/archive/2026-02-phase1/MIGRATION_PHASE1.md` for historical details.

   - Drag cases from the left sidebar onto the truck bed
   - Click and drag cases to reposition them
   - Use mouse controls to orbit/zoom the camera
   - Select cases to see dimensions and properties
3. Use **Auto Pack** for automatic space optimization

### Exporting

**Export Full App**:

- Click **Export** in the topbar to download complete app state as JSON
- Includes all packs, cases, and preferences

**Export Single Pack**:

- Open pack's menu (three vertical dots)
- Select **Export JSON**
- Share the file with others

**Export to PDF/Excel**:

- In Editor, click **Export PDF** or **Export Excel**
- Generates professional reports with pack details and case lists

### Importing

**Import App Backup**:

- Click **Import** in topbar
- Select a previously exported app JSON file
- App state will be restored

**Import Pack**:

- On Packs screen, click **Import Pack**
- Select a pack JSON file (from someone else or backup)
- Pack will be added to your library

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **3D Engine**: Three.js r185 / `0.185.1`, installed from npm
- **Development and Build Tool**: Vite `8.2.0`
- **Type Checking**: `typescript` is kept as a dev tool to run `npm run typecheck` (`tsc` with
  `--allowJs --checkJs`) against JavaScript sources
- **Production Format**: Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and application-owned bundled assets
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with JSON export/import
- **Browser Requirements**: Modern browser with WebGL 2 support

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Save Often**: Use Export to create backups before major changes
2. **Case Library**: Build your case library first before creating packs
3. **Colors**: Use distinct colors for different case types for easy visual identification
4. **Auto-Pack**: Try auto-pack first, then manually adjust as needed
5. **Search**: Use search on Packs screen to quickly find projects (press Esc to clear)
6. **Theme**: Toggle theme from sidebar bottom for comfortable viewing
7. **Performance Debugging**: Press `P` in the editor to see FPS, frame time, memory, and renderer
   stats; useful when testing on lower-end devices or 4K displays
8. **Safe Imports**: Imports and backups are sanitized to drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`
   keys; malformed JSON shows a toast instead of breaking the app

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 90+ (ES2020 support)
- ✅ Firefox 103+ (backdrop-filter support; 88-102 partial support)
- ✅ Safari 15+ (WebGL 2 support)
- ✅ Edge 90+ (ES2020 support)

**Note**: Requires WebGL 2 and ES2020 features including optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish
coalescing (`??`).

## Help

Click the **Help** button in the topbar for quick reference on Export/Import features.

## Security & Performance

- **Three.js/OrbitControls via npm**: Vite bundles both from the same pinned `three@0.185.1`
  package; the temporary `window.THREE` contract remains available and app init still waits for
  Three.js readiness.
- **Sanitized JSON**: All imports and localStorage loads strip dangerous keys (`__proto__`,
  `prototype`, `constructor`) to reduce prototype pollution risk.
- **Safe Rendering**: User/imported text now uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` in dialogs
  and headers.
- **Dev Overlay**: Press `P` in the editor to view FPS, frame time, memory (if available), and
  renderer info (draw calls, tris, geometries, textures) with periodic console logs.

  integration, and Graphify routing for scoped AI context retrieval.
- **Generic Space Utilization Engine** — capacity-only spatial analysis (occupied %, remaining
  space, density visualization); not a safety or compliance score.
- **Three.js r185.1 via npm/Vite** — Three.js migrated from vendor CDN to npm + Vite build
  pipeline; pinned at `three@0.185.1`.
- **Quantity Controls** — ecommerce-style Case Qty, atomic Undo/Redo, Load Plans qty surfaces.
- **Business Identity** — Case item codes, Load Plan numbers, customer references.
- **Billing/Platform Foundation** — server-side workspace limits, org security, slug integrity,
  normalized billing entitlement.
