# Truck Packer 3D — Master TODO V6

**Last updated:** 2026-10-17
**Status:** Active operational roadmap.

---

## 1. Document Authority / Purpose

1. V6 is the current operational source of truth for Truck Packer 3D.
2. V5 (`TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md`) is frozen/historical — do not use it to determine active work.
3. This document contains: current baseline, recently completed milestones, the current active milestone
   (if any), unapproved candidate workstreams, deferred work, critical invariants, and technical-debt
   follow-ups. A workstream is not active or approved until Section 4 names it.
4. Git history and project memory hold detailed implementation history. Do not paste full reports here.
5. Domain contracts win within their stated scope:
   - [Billing Entitlement Rules](./BILLING_ENTITLEMENT_RULES.md)
   - [AutoPack Engine Contract](../engineering/autopack-engine-contract.md)
6. Update at milestone closeout only. Replace stale status; do not append contradictory blocks.
7. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `src/CLAUDE.md` define agent working rules and point here for status.

## 2. Current Baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository branch | `main` |
| V6 creation baseline | `002c1f187b4a67fae6a1cbfde373c233f83d42f7` (snapshot at V6 creation; historical reference only) |
| Verified main at P2.5 start (2026-10-03) | `fe4bfe3be2b9a77b0d7ef9fc183fa08fd0ed15e3` — PR #95 merged; local `main` matched `origin/main` before branching |
| Last merge before P2.5 | PR #95 `cleanup: complete P2 legacy and dead code cleanup` |
| P2.5 implementation base | `test/p2-5-suite-ci-optimization` branched from that verified main; its PR and merge commit record the final P2.5 state |
| Three.js runtime | `three@0.185.1` via npm/Vite (WebGLRenderer, r185.1) |
| Vite | `8.2.1` |
| Node requirement | `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0` |
| Verified main after CI optimization (2026-10-17) | `a3c47f28c7930778771ac0806d398be22ed712a4` — PR #123 merged; main updated on GitHub |
| Verified main after Camera Controls Relocation (2026-10-17) | `c28fca550d827b67d855832ea913a57cf8423674` — PR #124 merged |
| Measurement Tool V1 branch | `feat/editor-measurement-tool-v1`, created from `c28fca550d827b67d855832ea913a57cf8423674`; contract approved; implementation visually approved by the owner on 2026-10-18 and locally validated (lint, typecheck, Node and browser lanes, build, audit); GitHub Quality Gate and final merge approval pending (Section 4.1) |
| Quality Gate cost policy | One automatic full Quality Gate for PRs targeting `main`; optional manual `workflow_dispatch`; no automatic full run after merge/push to `main`. Focused local checks during implementation; documentation-only changes require diff/status checks, not application suites. |

## 4. Current Active / Next Milestone

**Current status:** Measurement Tool V1 is the next milestone. Its contract is owner-approved and locked (Section 4.1) and branch `feat/editor-measurement-tool-v1` exists from `c28fca5`, and the Stage 0 documentation checkpoint is owner-approved. **The implementation is on the branch. The owner reviewed it on 2026-10-17, requested a UX correction pass and small header adjustments, and visually approved the result on 2026-10-18; the owner then specified that one Escape press fully exits Measurement Mode, which is implemented and covered by specs. Local validation passed (ESLint, Stylelint, HTML validation, typecheck, the Node and Chromium test lanes with new measurement specs, production build, dependency audit). Status: implementation visually approved and locally validated; GitHub Quality Gate and final merge approval pending.** Camera Phase 1, Camera Phase 2, optional Zoom Controls and the Camera Controls relocation are complete and merged (PRs #120–#124). The owner accepted live PDF verification for Camera Phase 2 on 2026-10-17. PR #123 closed the duplicate full Quality Gate after merge.

### Owner-approved next sequence (planning order, not blanket implementation authorization)

| Order | Milestone | Intended outcome / contract to define | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Measurement Tool V1** | Illustrative, informational point-to-point ruler saved with each Load Plan. Approved scope, non-goals, anchoring and persistence rules, and stage gates: Section 4.1. | **CONTRACT APPROVED — implementation visually approved and locally validated; GitHub Quality Gate and final merge approval pending** |
| 2 | **Annotations: Text and Drawing** | Add notes/labels and graphical marks/arrows independently of cargo geometry. Define anchoring, editing, storage, visibility, permissions, and screenshot/PDF inclusion before coding. Text and Drawing can be scoped into small releases. | **PLANNED — after Measurement** |
| 3 | **PDF Construction / Interactive Export Preview** | Clicking **Export PDF** opens a document-construction screen showing the proposed PDF. Users can modify the presentation/layout and content before selecting the final **Export PDF** action. Specify available editing, page reordering/layout, accurate print preview, templates/persistence, billing gates, and export safety in its product contract. Do not mutate cargo data by editing the document. | **PLANNED — after Annotations** |

**Removed from roadmap:** Zoom to Area / Magnifying Glass. Do not implement or propose it as part of Zoom Controls or the Measurement Tool.

**Owner sequencing:** Finish Measurement first, then Annotations (Text and Drawing), then PDF Construction. Each phase requires its own scoped acceptance and release checkpoint. Do not bundle these into a single implementation branch.

**Held work:** C5 AutoPack quality and related follow-ups are **PAUSED** due to unresolved load realism/transport-quality concerns. C6 reporting is **DEFERRED**. No changes to separate stabilization, Claude visual, or Codex visual worktrees are authorized.

### 4.1 Measurement Tool V1 — Approved Contract

**Status:** 🔒 Locked 2026-10-17 (owner-approved, including Stage 0 and the derived rules below). **Revised 2026-10-17 by the owner after visual review** (decisions 1, 3 and 4, the Interaction, Management and Presentation bullets, derived rule 3 and the non-goals); those revisions and their implementation were **visually approved by the owner on 2026-10-18**, and the same day the owner made Escape a one-press exit from the mode. Status: **implementation visually approved and locally validated; GitHub Quality Gate and final merge approval pending.** New specs pin G1–G6 and the interaction contract: `tests/audit/measurement-tool-core.spec.mjs`, `measurement-tool-lifecycle.spec.mjs` (Node lane) and `measurement-tool-interaction.spec.mjs` (Chromium lane). Branch `feat/editor-measurement-tool-v1`; baseline `c28fca550d827b67d855832ea913a57cf8423674`. Agent-facing summary: `AGENTS.md` (Measurement Tool V1 Invariants).

**Nature:** An illustrative, informational point-to-point ruler. Measurements are planning references — not certified measurements, minimum-clearance results, or safety/compliance findings. It is not a placement, load-optimization or AutoPack feature, and it never changes handling rules, collision, cargo physics, assessment, Space Utilization or the existing PDF. Keep the user-facing experience simple.

| # | Owner decision (locked) |
|---|---|
| 1 | ~~Box-shaped cargo only.~~ **Revised 2026-10-17 (owner, after visual review):** a point can be placed on **any cargo surface, any shape** (box, cylinder, drum). The picked point is stored in the cargo's local frame, so it follows the cargo. |
| 2 | A **malformed** measurement structure rejects import/restore under the existing strict contracts. A structurally valid record that references deleted or missing cargo is **retained as Unresolved**. |
| 3 | Creating, renaming, deleting or **repositioning an endpoint of** a measurement updates the Load Plan's `lastEdited` but **never creates a cargo Undo/Redo entry**. *(Endpoint repositioning added 2026-10-17 by the owner; visually approved 2026-10-18.)* |
| 4 | ~~Floor surfaces only.~~ **Revised 2026-10-17 (owner, after visual review):** a point can be placed **anywhere that is visible**: truck floor surfaces (main floor, Wheel Well tops, over-cab/raised deck), truck walls, ceiling and end planes, and the **ground anywhere, including outside the truck**. Floor points are revalidated by geometry; truck-shell points remember the truck and flag Needs Review if it changes; ground points never move. Nothing is ever relocated. |
| 5 | A previously valid measurement that becomes unresolvable **stays stored and visibly flagged**. Never silently delete, relocate or substitute an anchor. |
| 6 | **Maximum 100** saved measurements per Load Plan. |

**Behavior**

- *Control:* ruler button directly above Camera Views in the floating viewport group (order: Measurement, Camera Views, Zoom In, Zoom Out); active state uses the existing orange selected styling. Setting: Settings → Preferences → Editor Display → **Show Measurement Tool** (default On; existing Save changes; lightweight visibility route, no scene rebuild; independent of Show Camera/Zoom Controls). Hiding the button while the mode is active exits the mode and cancels an unfinished measurement; saved measurements are untouched.
- *Interaction:* first valid click = Point A; pointer move previews a dashed line and the distance; second valid click = Point B, saves exactly one measurement, releases the gesture and returns directly to Ready for Point A while the mode stays active (up to the 100 cap). In the mode, primary clicks place points instead of selecting or dragging cargo and never change the cargo selection or placement; orbit, pan, wheel and trackpad stay available; **one Escape press exits Measurement Mode completely** *(owner-specified 2026-10-18)*: an unfinished Point A or endpoint drag is dropped without writing, saved measurements stay, the panel and overlay hide exactly as when the ruler is clicked again, and the key is consumed so it never also deselects cargo, triggers another shortcut or closes a mobile drawer. A modal, dropdown, text field (such as a rename) or the load-status popover that owns Escape keeps it and closes first (the next Escape exits), and with the mode off Escape behaves as before. Focus is never sent to the ruler: it returns to the 3D viewport (with no focus frame after mouse use, and the normal ring after keyboard use). Clicking the ruler again also exits. Cargo keyboard shortcuts, including Delete, keep acting on the cargo selection as they always do (cargo edits stay undoable through cargo history); a pending point or drag whose cargo is deleted or changed is cancelled and writes nothing, and the stored measurement is kept and flagged, never deleted. A valid pick is acknowledged by the marker/line itself (no ripple); a click that hits nothing (only pure sky) says so with a notice and never invents depth. Press/release within 6px counts as a click, larger movement is an orbit/pan drag. A click on a drawn line or its label selects that measurement; a click near an endpoint places a point, so a new measurement can start at the corner of an existing one.
- *Record* (`pack.measurements`, owned by exactly one Load Plan, canonical inches): unique ID, type `point-to-point`, optional label, start anchor, end anchor, `createdAt`/`updatedAt`, `schemaVersion`. The distance is never stored: it is the 3D straight line between the currently resolved endpoints displayed in the user's Length unit as a single distance (no L/W/H breakdown), and never called clearance.
- *Cargo anchor:* cargo **instance ID** (never Case ID), the picked point in the cargo's local frame (any shape), geometry signature (shape + dimensions). A duplicated instance never inherits measurements; a replacement with the same Case never receives an anchor. *Floor anchor:* a supported truck floor point (main floor, Wheel Well top, deck), revalidated by geometry. *Space anchor:* a fixed point on the truck wall/ceiling/end plane (remembers the truck) or on the ground or anywhere else (never moves). None of these move with cargo.
- *Validity (derived, never stored):* **Valid** = both anchors resolve. **Needs Review** = a referenced Case's shape/dimensions or the truck geometry changed so the reference is uncertain. **Unresolved** = cargo instance or surface gone, or record unreconstructable; shows an explanatory indicator, never a fabricated number. Validity re-derives automatically, so undoing a cargo deletion or restoring original dimensions returns a measurement to Valid.
- *Management:* create several, rename, see status, delete individually (one click, no confirm step, not undoable). **Endpoint repositioning** *(owner-approved 2026-10-17, visually approved 2026-10-18):* select a measurement (its line, its label or its list row) and drag either line-style grip onto any supported surface; the anchor kind may change and cargo anchors stay cargo-local. The drag shows a faint ghost of the original and the live distance. Release on a valid surface writes one measurement-only edit (`lastEdited`, no cargo Undo entry). Escape (which also leaves the mode), pointer cancel, a drop on nothing, a blocking operation or leaving the Load Plan restores the original and writes nothing. Cargo is never moved, rotated, staged or selected by it. No measurement Undo/Redo in V1. Editing or deleting cargo never deletes a measurement.
- *Presentation* *(visually approved 2026-10-18)*: an architectural dimension-line style: thin neutral lines with short perpendicular end ticks over a soft surface-colour underlay and a compact one-distance label (a user-given name is added only while that measurement is selected); brand orange only for the selected or actively edited measurement (grips, preview line, label border). No rings, ripples or glow. The list is a compact, collapsible panel (heading, count, one row per measurement with its distance, rename and delete); guidance text appears only when relevant. The panel can be dragged by its header, whose 2×3 dot grip matches the AutoPack Results grip and shows both expanded and collapsed; it stays inside the viewport and its position is a per-session view convenience, not saved with the Load Plan *(owner-requested 2026-10-17, visually approved 2026-10-18)*.

**Anchoring and validity rules**

| Topic | Rule |
|---|---|
| Cargo-local anchoring | Stored as a point in the cargo's local frame (any shape; the earlier box face + normalized position encoding is still read); no world coordinate is stored for cargo anchors. Resolved by a pure, THREE-free resolver from committed pose and Case dimensions: `transform.position`, right-angle `rotation` (Euler XYZ, `core/oriented-dims.js`), ignoring `transform.scale` and applying the same minimum-height floor as the scene's `applyTransform`. Parity with THREE is pinned across all right-angle rotations. Follows move, rotate, flip, stage/unstage and the committed AutoPack pose. |
| Committed vs. transient | Saved data and creation use committed poses only. While a drag, gizmo hold, animation or AutoPack Results preview is shown, the overlay follows the pose the scene displays (it never floats) but nothing transient is persisted. |
| Case change | Geometry-signature mismatch (shape or L/W/H) → Needs Review. Nothing is rewritten, rescaled or re-anchored. |
| Space change | Floor anchors are revalidated by geometry against the current truck: same supported floor surface still present → Valid; surface present but its governing truck geometry changed so the reference is uncertain → Needs Review; surface gone → Unresolved. Never moved to another surface. Truck wall/ceiling/end points are Valid only while the truck is the one they were placed on (otherwise Needs Review); ground and free points are always Valid. |
| Deleted / recovered cargo | Deleting an instance leaves its measurements stored and Unresolved. Undo restores the same instance ID and the anchor resolves again. Duplicate and import use an explicit old→new instance-ID map — never a guessed match. |

**Acceptance gates — the six audit risk areas.** Each must be handled explicitly and pinned by a test. Passing `measurements` through a generic object spread is **not** sufficient for persistence or validation.

| Gate | Required handling | Code surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| G1 Normalization / persistence | `normalizePack` is an explicit field whitelist: add `measurements`. Older plans normalize to `[]`; ≤100 enforced. **Non-destructive local recovery:** a malformed stored record must never be silently dropped and then overwritten by autosave. Local load never throws and never produces geometry from it; the original data is preserved, a recovery condition is surfaced, and destructive persistence of that Load Plan's measurements is prevented until the condition is resolved. Exact mechanism: Stage 1 design. | `core/normalizer.js` `normalizePack`/`normalizeAppData`; `PackLibrary.update` |
| G2 Undo/Redo | History snapshots all of `packLibrary`; measurements must be carried across Undo/Redo from the current state per Load Plan (as `editorView` is), written with `skipHistory`, and added to the `lastEdited` keys. Cargo Undo/Redo must neither erase nor resurrect measurements, and must not roll back `lastEdited` solely because measurement edits are excluded from cargo history (Undo/Redo is otherwise unchanged). Exact mechanism: Stage 2 design. | `core/state-store.js` `restoreCargoHistory`; `PackLibrary.update` |
| G3 Duplicate / import remap | `duplicate()` and `planPackImport()` regenerate instance IDs: both must apply one shared old→new map to cargo anchors. Unmapped anchors stay Unresolved. Instance IDs must be preserved by AutoPack Apply, Unpack, Truck Change and Add/Qty staging — assert in tests. | `services/pack-library.js` `duplicate`, `planPackImport`; `editor-screen.js` `buildAppliedAutoPackCases` |
| G4 Export / backup / restore | Single and batch Load Plan export/import, Workspace Backup and Active Workspace Backup must all carry measurements via explicit projection, strict validation before normalization, and atomic apply. Malformed structure (including >100, duplicate IDs within a plan) rejects the whole import/restore. A cargo reference to a missing instance is **accepted** (Unresolved) — the dangling-`caseId` rejection rule must not be reused for it. | `core/import-schema.js` `projectPortablePack`, `projectPortableWorkspacePack`, `validateWorkspaceGraph`; `services/import-export.js` `validateWorkspacePack`, `parsePackImportJSON`, `parsePackBatchImportJSON` |
| G5 Capture exclusion | Lines, handles and labels are an SVG/DOM layer above the canvas, so no canvas capture can include them: Screenshot, PDF views, pack preview/thumbnail and AutoPack Results preview capture never show measurement graphics. Existing PDF unchanged. | `index.html` `#editor-measure-labels`; `editor/measurement-tool.js` |
| G6 Pointer / keyboard ownership | One mode owner gates `onDown`/`onMove`/`onUp`/`onDblClick`/`onKeyDown`; ordinary clicks never `stopPropagation` (OrbitControls shares the canvas); the only claimed press is one on the selected measurement's grip (capture phase, so neither OrbitControls nor the Editor sees it; released on pointer up or cancel); 6px click threshold; one Escape exits the mode through `exit()` (dropping a drag or pending point without writing) in the capture phase, consuming the key before `deselectAll` and the drawer-close handler, and yielding to modal, dropdown, text-field and popover owners; guard double-click zero-length and a pending point or drag under Undo/Delete (Undo cancels only the gesture; Delete acts on the cargo selection and `sync()` cancels a gesture that lost its cargo); Cargo `raycastFirst` is not reused as-is (no face data, cargo only). | `screens/editor-screen.js` interaction handlers; `ui/keyboard-manager.js` |

**Derived rules — OWNER APPROVED 2026-10-17** (follow from decisions 2, 5 and 6 and the "never fabricate" principle):

1. Only a Valid measurement shows a numeric distance; Needs Review and Unresolved show an explanatory indicator instead.
2. More than 100 measurements in an import/restore is malformed and rejects the import; nothing is truncated, and the 100 cap blocks creation in the UI.
3. Creating, renaming, deleting and repositioning measurements is disabled while an Editor operation that changes the plan is busy (AutoPack, Unpack, Truck Change, Truck Change preview) or any transient preview (including AutoPack Results preview) is displayed; viewing remains available, and the message names the actual cause. A background thumbnail capture only reads pixels back: it is **not** such an operation and never blocks a measurement or cancels an unfinished one (found and fixed in the 2026-10-17 correction pass: it used to cancel Point A with a misleading "operation is running" message).
4. A cargo instance whose Case definition is missing is Unresolved (geometry cannot be verified).
5. Measurement IDs are unique within a Load Plan only; duplicate/import may regenerate them.

**Non-goals:** Text Annotations, Drawing, PDF Construction, AutoPack changes, clearance/gap analysis or any safety or compliance claim, any handles beyond the two line-style endpoint grips, measurement Undo/Redo, snapping beyond the picked surface point, database or backend changes, and any change to existing PDF/image exports (data is stored only so the future PDF Construction milestone can consume it).

**Implementation stages** (each requires explicit owner release; focused local checks per stage; owner visual acceptance and one PR Quality Gate at closeout):

| Stage | Scope | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | This documentation checkpoint | ✅ Owner-approved 2026-10-17 (documentation commit on this branch) |
| 1 | Data foundation, no UI: pure measurement module (schema, normalize/validate, resolver, validity, distance); `normalizePack` field; cap; G1 non-destructive local recovery | Legacy plan → `[]`; malformed/over-cap cases; malformed stored record is preserved, surfaced and not overwritten by autosave; resolver parity across all right-angle rotations; scale and min-height parity; signature and floor predicate; typecheck |
| 2 | Lifecycle plumbing, no UI: G2 history carry-over, `skipHistory` writes and `lastEdited` (no rollback by Undo/Redo); G3 remap; G4 projection and validation | Tests modelled on `pack-camera-view-isolation.spec.mjs`; Undo/Redo keeps measurements and `lastEdited`; ID-set preservation asserted; round-trip for every import/export path including malformed rejection |
| 3 | Setting and control shell: `showMeasurementTool` through defaults, normalizer, Settings and the visibility route; ruler button and mode flag, no tool behavior | Existing camera/zoom control tests stay green; lightweight-route test; hide-while-active exits mode |
| 4 | Interaction (G6): mode owner, picking on any visible surface (cargo of any shape, truck floor/walls/ceiling, ground), pending point, click feedback, busy/preview gating, Escape exit and ownership | Existing selection, drag, keyboard and modal-ownership tests stay green; new ownership tests; localhost QA |
| 5 | Presentation: overlay pass and labels, list (rename/delete/status), G5 capture exclusion, disposal; UX correction pass 2026-10-17 (restrained dimension lines, one distance, endpoint grips and repositioning, compact collapsible list; visually approved 2026-10-18) | Exclusion tests for screenshot/PDF/thumbnail/preview; both projections and themes; no resource growth across repeated toggles |
| 6 | Closeout: owner visual acceptance, one PR Quality Gate, Section 3 row | Owner acceptance; gate green |

**Open technical items (settle in Stage 1; none blocks the contract):** the mechanism for the G1 non-destructive local-recovery invariant (preserve the original record, surface the condition, block destructive autosave until resolved) and, in Stage 2, for the G2 `lastEdited` invariant; the floor-surface source of truth (the editor's `TrailerGeometry` duplicates `PackLibrary` zone formulas — consume one and pin parity); a measurement-specific length formatter (`formatLength` rounds inches to whole numbers); confirmation that Truck Change preserves instance IDs (not traced in the audit).

## 5. Candidate Workstreams (Unapproved)

These are unapproved candidates outside the owner-approved sequence in Section 4. No candidate is an active implementation merely because it appears here. Items remain subject to individual product decisions and owner authorization; the sequence in Section 4 takes precedence.

1. **Professional 3D Editor Visual Foundation**
   - Cargo box presentation, edges/lines, labels, materials; selection/hover clarity, contact cues; truck visual hierarchy
   - Do not rewrite renderer architecture
   - **Reverted:** PRs #29, #31, and #33 were rejected and reverted in PR #34 (`6c305fc`); no restart without explicit owner approval

2. **PDF / Image Visualization Polish**
   - Optional future image/report styling beyond the already planned **PDF Construction / Interactive Export Preview** workflow in Section 4
   - Do not start a competing PDF export redesign before that product contract is settled

3. **Small 3D Visual Asset Spike (GLB)**
   - Test representative GLB assets before a full library: simple pallet, medium appliance, complex vehicle
   - Test at 1 / 25 / 100 / 300 counts

4. **Folder Sidebar Implementation**

5. **Load Plans / Stops / Unload Sequence**
   - Define sequencing/data model before Auto-Pack v2

6. **Auto-Pack v2 / Strategy Revisit**
   - Builds on a finalized load/unload model; remains held with C5

7. **Asset Manager + Curated Model Library**

8. **Measured Renderer Optimization**
   - Only after GLBs and richer visual scenes are available for realistic measurements

9. **Expanded 3D World / Environment Work**
   - Includes future 3D realism work, subject to explicit design approval

10. **Email Delivery / Sharing**

11. **Broader Shortcut / UI Consolidation**

12. **Settings Cleanup**

13. **Beta / Launch Hardening**
    - Observability, code/security audit, deployment/server review and production readiness before broad beta

14. **Real 3D Heatmap + Legend — LOW PRIORITY / NEAR LAST**
    - Optional visual enhancement, not required for core logistics planning
    - Postpone until **after 3D realism and richer scene presentation**
    - If later approved, build on the Generic Space Utilization Engine; capacity analysis only, not safety/compliance scoring

**Completed, not a candidate:** Camera / View System (PRs #120–#121) and optional Zoom Controls (PR #122).

## 5.5. Phase C — Editor Authority & Workflow Continuity (C5 Cycle)

**Status:** Locked product contract; C5A merged (PR #111). PR #117 merged scoped C5 stabilization changes. **C5 further implementation is PAUSED by explicit owner decision.** The prior C5B review state below is historical only; it does not authorize resumption.

**C5D recorded transport-realism finding:** Normal AutoPack can produce tall exposed stack faces without meaningful longitudinal blocking. Balanced optimizes packing/layout heuristics but does not establish truck-wide braking restraint or complete transport securement. C5D should investigate passive restraint and layout realism without claiming to certify tiedowns, friction, load bars or regulatory securement. This is recorded for future investigation; C5A introduces no transport-restraint solver behavior.

### C5-0 Product Contract (Locked)

See [AutoPack Engine Contract — Editor Authority and Automation Boundary](../engineering/autopack-engine-contract.md#editor-authority-and-automation-boundary) for the full contract.

**Core Principle:** Cargo Planner 3D is a manual load-planning workspace first. AutoPack is an assistant, not an override.

- Manual Editor is user-authoritative.
- AutoPack is assistant/recommendation.
- Hard physical geometry remains enforced for new manual placement.
- Handling/planning rules generally assess/warn rather than block manual editing.
- Manual VALID/INCOMPLETE/INVALID layouts may remain saved.
- Assessment does not grant/revoke editing permission.
- No silent repair.
- Missing definitions degrade physical certainty, not workflow availability.
- Untrusted unresolved cargo falls back to staging during geometry changes.
- Future load/unload sequence remains manually overridable.
- Automated solutions may be stricter than manual authoring.

### C5M Manual Editor Findings Registry

| ID | Finding | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-01 | Manual drop may commit collision/occupied-space problems | RETAIN | Focused C5M verification required |
| M-02 | Staged cargo sometimes refuses an apparently valid truck-floor drop | RETAIN | User-observed; latest controlled QA did not reliably reproduce; do not rewrite drag architecture speculatively |
| M-03 | Manual action sometimes receives unrelated vertical-move messages | RETAIN | User-observed; latest controlled QA did not reproduce; investigate when reproducible |
| M-04 | AutoPack planning state must never become a permanent manual movement restriction | 🔒 LOCKED | Product invariant |
| M-05 | Handling rules should evaluate manual layouts, not generally block authoring | 🔒 LOCKED | Product decision |
| M-06 | Impossible physical geometry remains blocked | 🔒 LOCKED | Product decision |
| M-07 | Manual INVALID/INCOMPLETE layouts remain editable and saveable | 🔒 LOCKED | Product decision |

### Execution Notes

- C5A merged through PR #111 and scoped C5 stabilization merged through PR #117. Earlier C5B local-implementation notes are superseded by the owner's pause; do not resume from an old worktree or branch without renewed approval. Keep C5M and C5T separate.
- C5M owns manual drag/move/rotate/stage/unstage authority and handling rules warning behavior.
- C5T owns unresolved cargo preservation and fallback behavior.
- **No C5 implementation is currently authorized.** C5B/C5M/C5T/C5C/C5D/C5E require new explicit owner approval; C6 remains deferred.

## 6. Deferred / Future Work

Not approved branches. Not active work. Require focused audits and product decisions before implementation.

- Next-generation billing hardening (workspace-to-Stripe identity, cross-table consistency, billing anomaly logging)
- Workspace Slug Phase 2 (friendly slugs, owner-editable, routing)
- Pack Publishing / Crew View / Share Links
- Server-backed packs/cases and conflict-safe sync
- Business Identity server-persistence uniqueness contract
- Workspace-level analytics and telemetry
- Platform-admin schema and audit records
- CoG / axle / crush / DOT weight-distribution (requires explicit safety contracts)
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages, branch previews, staging, rollback policy
- Product decisions still open: consolidated billing, one Customer per workspace vs. shared, final commercial plans

---

## 7. Critical Architecture Invariants

### Billing

- Stripe is payment truth. `/billing-status` is application entitlement truth.
- Normalized `entitlementStatus` only — never overload raw `status`.
- Valid states: `active`, `trialing`, `trial_expired`, `included_in_plan`, `workspace_limit_reached`, `owner_subscription_required`, `billing_unavailable`.
- Owners only for checkout, portal, plan, and payment.
- Do not gate owner inheritance on `ownerUserId !== currentUserId`.

### Development / CI Cost Policy

- Full Quality Gate runs automatically on PRs targeting `main`; optional manual dispatch is available. No automatic full suite after merging/pushing to `main` (PR #123).
- During implementation, use directly affected focused tests, typecheck as appropriate, and diff/status inspection. Do not duplicate broad local and GitHub CI runs.
- Documentation-only updates require diff review and whitespace/status checks, not application test suites.

### AutoPack / Editor

- Use `src/core/operation-lifecycle.js` for all mutating editor operations.
- Large-load snap: `> 300` packed placements — performance guard, not final solution.
- Wheel Wells wider-than-shelf and Front Overhang C2 require explicit safety contracts before implementation.
- Final saved state must never depend on animation completion.
- Camera orbit/pan/zoom must remain usable during operations.

### Space Utilization

- **Capacity analysis only:** occupied %, remaining space, density visualization.
- Not safety scoring, not compliance scoring, not weight-distribution quality.
- Internal diagnostics must not become user-facing scores without a future explicit product decision.

### 3D Architecture

- Direct Three.js + WebGLRenderer, currently r185.1 via npm/Vite.
- No React/R3F rewrite. No WebGPU migration now.
- Future addons via `three/addons`.
- GLB architecture (when introduced): authoritative packing envelope is always separate from optional visual model. Visual model never becomes collision truth by default. Keep technical-box fallback.

### Backend / Persistence Direction

- Supabase remains the temporary development backend for identity, workspaces, and billing.
- Cases, Load Plans, and related business data remain browser-local during this development phase.
- NoCodeBackend (NCB) remains the preferred future migration target. A September 2026 investigation found NCB could be viable, but the migration is paused, not canceled, so product, domain, email, billing, settings, and workspace-behavior work can be completed first — see [NCB Migration Investigation — Paused](../archive/2026-09-ncb-migration-paused/README.md).
- No active backend migration branch exists. A future migration must repeat the provider and source audit against the application state at that time. This entry does not authorize migration implementation.

### Data and Identity

- Customer-facing object name: **Load Plan** (not "Pack").
- Internal architecture: `PackLibrary`, `pack`, `pack.id`, DOM ids, CSS classes, storage keys, route identifiers, JSON schema unchanged.
- Auto-Pack, Unpack, packed item, packing rules vocabulary preserved.
- "Cargo Planner 3D" is the provisional product name — not yet applied in UI. Final branding deferred to launch prep.

## 8. Technical Debt / Security Follow-ups

- `.claude/settings.local.json` — git-ignored, previously flagged as potentially containing credential-bearing commands. Do not print or modify during normal sessions. Dedicated security/credential cleanup required before broad beta.
- Development retains legacy schema differences (cases/packs, policy/function, billing ID). Separate audit required.
- Workspace Slug Phase 2 (friendly slugs) remains required product work.
- `docs/product/PROJECT_TREE.md` is a point-in-time snapshot (2026-07-16) — no active authority.
- Graphify: run `graphify update .` after significant code changes. Do not hardcode node/edge counts in permanent instructions.

### P2 — Legacy / Dead Code: COMPLETE (2026-10)

Confirmed dead ordinary code is removed, test-pinned dead code is removed, the duplicate legacy Settings screen is retired safely, broken unused tooling is removed, and materially stale active contracts are corrected. The registry below records what remains on purpose so future audits do not reopen it. Provider/persistence and rendering cleanup are **not** complete; they are assigned to their own phases.

**Intentional KEEP (not dead code):**

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| `getCurrentAuthKey`, `debugAuthSnapshot`, `getMyMembership`, `getCurrentOrganization`, and the documented test/admin exports published via `window.__TP3D_SUPABASE_API` / `__TP3D_SUPABASE` / `SupabaseClient` | Public/debug/backward-compat surface; no in-repo caller is not proof of no consumer |
| `src/packing-core/{index,domain,space-model,orientation}.js` | Intentional, tested Phase-5 architectural boundary; do not delete as orphans |
| `src/core/utils.js` | Still has live production and test consumers |
| `vendor/three.module.js` (r160) | Intentional documented test fixture; production Three is npm r185 (`src/bootstrap/three-runtime.js`) |
| Browser harness `esm.sh` / `skypack` abort route (`tests/behavioral/app-js-browser-harness.mjs`) | Guards against accidental reintroduction of CDN Three loading |
| Storage legacy v1 migration (`src/core/storage.js`) | Backward compatibility for old persisted data |
| Retired HTTP 410 Edge Function tombstones (`supabase/functions/*`) | Provider/external endpoint compatibility; frontend call-graph absence does not prove no external caller |
| Constant-false auth/provider flags (e.g. `AUTH_GUARD_*_ENABLED`) | Explicit dormant provider gates; provider/persistence scope |
| Persisted `preferences.spaceUtilization` compatibility fields | Old backups/imported preferences may still carry them |

**Explicit DEFER (not dead-code cleanup):**

| Item | Owner |
|---|---|
| AccountOverlay module/lifecycle (the old opener is removed; auth-transition `close()` / `handleAuthChange` wiring remains) | Future auth/provider cleanup |
| `getSessionRawSingleFlight` and related auth internal state / string probes | Provider/persistence cleanup |
| Legacy `BillingService` compatibility helper object (`src/data/services/billing.service.js`) | Billing/provider cleanup |
| `readJson` / `writeJson` / `removeKey` (`src/core/storage.js`; may have no ordinary callers now) | Provider/persistence/recovery cleanup |
| DevOverlay (`src/editor/scene-runtime.js`) | Rendering phase |
| CoG visual marker / `updateCoG` | Rendering / future CoG safety work |

## 9. AI Memory Infrastructure

```
Config:    .ai/memory.json
CLI:       bash tools/project-memory query|record|promote "<text>"
Vault:     Truck-Packer-3D Obsidian Markdown vault (path in .ai/memory.json)
```

- `query` — retrieval works without a semantic memory graph (exact-match by default).
- `record` — record meaningful completed milestones.
- `promote` — promote durable Decisions, Lessons, or Problems.
- Semantic Graphify indexing of the memory vault is optional and requires an external LLM API key.
