# Cargo Planner 3D — LLM QA and Repository Navigation Runbook

**Last verified:** 2026-08-04 · Code baseline: `main` at `7409b12` **Repository:** Truck Packer 3D
(`Fdeoliveira24/truck-packer-3d`)

---

## 1. Purpose and Audience

This is the required starting point for any agent performing browser QA, Playwright automation,
runtime debugging, UI review, stress testing, or end-to-end validation on the Truck Packer 3D
codebase.

**Before beginning a QA task, read Sections 1, 2, 9, and 23.** Use the remaining sections as a
reference according to the Fast Lookup Index.

This document exists to prevent agents from wasting context and tokens searching for entry points,
commands, selectors, test data, authentication requirements, debugging tools, or evidence locations
that are already known and verified.

This document is **not**:

- the active operational TODO (that is `docs/product/TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md`)
- a product roadmap
- an architecture contract
- a replacement for domain-specific test evidence
- permission to alter production data, remote resources, or active branches

## 2. Source-of-Truth Order

Each document class has a defined scope. Consult the most specific authority for the question at
hand.

| 2        | Operational source of truth        | `docs/product/TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md`                                                                                                            | Active task, approved branch, blockers, execution status                     |
| 3        | Domain contracts                   | `docs/engineering/autopack-engine-contract.md`, `docs/product/BILLING_ENTITLEMENT_RULES.md`, `docs/engineering/business-identity-contract-v1.md` | Permanent behavioral rules within each contract's stated scope               |

| 5        | Dedicated audit/evidence documents | `docs/audits/`, `docs/billing/`, `docs/dev/`                                                                                                     | Evidence supporting conclusions — do not derive active work items from these |
| 6        | Archived TODOs                     | `docs/archive/`                                                                                                                                  | Historical record only — never treat as current behavior                     |

**Scope guidance:**

- **Agent instructions** govern how agents work: what to edit, risk levels, change style.
- **V5** governs the active task, approved branch, blockers, and execution status.
- **Domain contracts** govern behavior inside their defined scope. The AutoPack contract rules
  AutoPack geometry; the billing entitlement rules rule billing semantics.
- **Current source and tests** describe actual runtime behavior. When behavior is ambiguous, source
  is authoritative over any document.
- **Audit/evidence documents** support conclusions but do not create or approve active work.
- **Archived documents** are historical only. Never treat an archived TODO as a description of
  current behavior.

When a domain contract and V5 appear to conflict, the domain contract governs behavior within its
stated scope; V5 governs whether that work is active or deferred.

**Boot globals** (verified in live browser, `window.__TP3D_BOOT` keys): `cdnFailures`,
`vendorLoaded`, `vendorPromises`, `vendorResolvers`, `fatalOverlayShown`, `maintenanceMode`,
`showAppStatusOverlay`, `threeReady`, `runtimeFatalHandlersInstalled`, `appReady`

**Maintenance mode:** Controlled by `window.__TP3D_FLAGS__.maintenanceMode` injected inline before
`src/app.js` imports. When true, the app shows a maintenance overlay and never imports app modules.

**CDN failures:** Each vendor registers with `__tp3dVendorOk`/`__tp3dVendorFail`. Failures
accumulate in `window.__TP3D_BOOT.cdnFailures`. The system overlay shows a CDN recovery UI when a
required vendor fails all fallbacks.

## 5. Main Product Surfaces

All surfaces verified against live DOM using the `main` baseline at `7409b12`.

### Screens

| Screen | Module | Root DOM ID | Notes | |---|---|---| ---| | Load Plans |
`src/screens/packs-screen.js` | `#screen-packs` | Customer-facing name; internal: Pack | | Cases |
`src/screens/cases-screen.js` | `#screen-cases` | Case library management | | Editor |
`src/screens/editor-screen.js` | `#screen-editor` | 3D scene, AutoPack, Inspector | | Release Notes
| `src/screens/updates-screen.js` | `#screen-updates` | Static update log | | Roadmap |
`src/screens/roadmap-screen.js` | `#screen-roadmap` | Static roadmap content | | Settings (screen) |
`src/screens/settings-screen.js` | `#screen-settings` | Per-user preferences: units, theme, label
size, snapping, grid, export resolution. Navigated to via the sidebar. |

**Settings surface note:** The app has two distinct Settings surfaces with different roles. The
**Settings screen** (`src/screens/settings-screen.js`, `#screen-settings`) shows per-user preference
controls accessible directly from the sidebar navigation. The **Settings overlay**
(`src/ui/overlays/settings-overlay.js`) is a full overlay opened via `openSettingsOverlay(tab)` that
hosts org-scoped settings: billing, workspace membership, invites, and org general settings. Agents
must not conflate the two.

**Selector stability guidance:**

- All `#id` values listed above are **current DOM IDs** verified in the live app.
- No `data-testid` attributes exist in the current codebase. Selectors by ID are the most reliable.
  Class selectors are fragile.
- If a selector breaks, inspect `index.html` directly — all structural IDs are defined there.

---

## 6. How to Start the Application

### 6.1 Static file server (primary development method)

The app ships as static assets. No build step is required.

```bash
# Any static HTTP server works. Example with VS Code Live Server:
# Open index.html in VS Code → "Open with Live Server"
# Default: http://localhost:5500/index.html

# Or with npx:
cd "/path/to/Truck Packer 3D"
npx serve . -l 5500
# URL: http://localhost:5500/index.html
```

- **Prerequisites:** None beyond a static server. Network access to CDN vendors (Three.js, Supabase
  JS, Font Awesome, TWEEN, jsPDF, XLSX) is required on first load. Local vendor fallbacks exist in
  `vendor/` but may be outdated.
- **Supabase required:** Yes — authentication and workspace data require a Supabase connection. The
  Supabase URL and anon key are embedded in the app at runtime from `src/core/supabase-client.js`.
  Without valid Supabase config, auth fails.
- **file:// URL:** The app comment states file:// works for demos. Some browser APIs (CORS,
  SharedArrayBuffer) are restricted on file://. Use http:// for reliable QA.
- **Environment variables:** None are required in the browser. Edge Function env vars are
  server-side only.

### 6.2 Local Supabase (for database/RLS/Edge Function testing)

```bash
# Start local Supabase stack
supabase start

# Expected URLs (from supabase/config.toml):
# API:  http://127.0.0.1:54321
# Studio: http://127.0.0.1:54323
# Inbucket email: http://127.0.0.1:54324

# ⚠️  DESTRUCTIVE LOCAL COMMAND — operator approval required.
# Drops and recreates the entire local database from scratch.
# Never run automatically. Verify the active Supabase target before running.
# This command only affects the local Docker instance — it never touches hosted dev or production.
supabase db reset
```

- **Prerequisites:** Docker running, `supabase` CLI installed, valid `supabase/config.toml`.
- **Warning:** Local Supabase uses a separate project configuration. The browser app still connects
  to the configured Supabase URL in `src/core/supabase-client.js`, which may point to the hosted
  development instance, not localhost. Switching between local and hosted requires code changes —
  confirm which target is active before testing.

### 6.3 Hosted development environment

- The app can be opened directly at the development Supabase-backed URL.
- Credentials and URL must be provided by the human operator (`<DEVELOPMENT_APP_URL>`).
- Used for deployed Edge Function testing and real network billing/Stripe flows.

### 6.4 No authenticated local browser startup without credentials

There is no anonymous or seed-account-based automated browser session. Browser QA past the auth
overlay always requires operator-supplied sign-in credentials.

---

## 7. Authentication and Test Accounts

### Auth flow

1. `src/app.js` initializes the Supabase client via `src/core/supabase-client.js`.
2. `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` listener is installed early in boot.
3. **Signed out:** `AuthOverlay` (`src/ui/overlays/auth-overlay.js`) is shown as a dialog. All app
   screens remain hidden behind it.
4. **Sign-in method:** Email + password via Supabase auth. Magic link is not currently the primary
   supported method.
5. **Callback behavior:** On successful auth, `onAuthStateChange` fires `SIGNED_IN`, workspace
   resolution begins, billing is refreshed, and screens are rendered.
6. **Session restoration:** Supabase persists the session in `localStorage`. On reload, the session
   is restored automatically before the auth overlay would show.
7. **Workspace resolution:** After auth, `workspaceReady()` polls org bundle until an active org is
   confirmed. If no org exists, the app shows an org-required banner.

### QA authentication

- No automated test accounts are provisioned in the current codebase.
- Credentials must be supplied by the human operator before browser QA.
- Placeholder for test account: `<QA_USER_EMAIL>` / `<QA_USER_PASSWORD>`
- Placeholder for app URL: `<DEVELOPMENT_APP_URL>`
- Verified QA path for local browser testing requires a real Supabase-authenticated user to be
  created in the target environment by the operator.

### What agents must never do

- Never print, log, or store email addresses, passwords, magic links, service-role keys, webhook
  secrets, or any private credentials.
- Never hardcode credentials into test files, source code, or documentation.
- Never reuse a production user's credentials for QA.

| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Local browser only (no local Supabase) | Browser UI QA against hosted dev Supabase          | Read/display QA, manual navigation, screenshot                                        | Writing to production tables, changing production data         | Operator QA credentials for dev Supabase | None — read-only                               |
| Local browser + local Supabase         | Database, RLS, Edge Function testing               | Local fixture seeding, local billing tests, membership/org tests, schema verification | Touching hosted dev or production                              | Operator local Supabase credentials      | `supabase db reset` or fixture cleanup scripts |
| Hosted development Supabase            | Deployed Edge Function QA, billing lifecycle tests | Fixture-scoped dev billing tests, workspace/org lifecycle tests                       | Modifying unrelated workspace data, touching production Stripe | Operator dev project credentials         | `npm run billing:fixtures:dev:cleanup`         |
| Stripe test mode                       | Stripe billing API QA                              | Test-mode Stripe events, webhook testing, checkout/portal flows                       | Live-mode Stripe keys, real customer charge                    | Operator Stripe test-mode keys           | `npm run billing:fixtures:stripe:cleanup`      |
| Production                             | Live customer environment                          | None during development QA                                                            | All QA operations                                              | N/A — do not use                         | N/A                                            |

**Absolute rule:** Disposable QA must never target production or real customer data. Any test that
writes to a database must run against local Supabase or a clearly isolated development fixture set.

## 9. Browser QA Fast Path

Use this checklist to begin useful browser QA in a few minutes.

1. **Confirm the exact repository folder, branch, and clean state.**
   - Confirm you are working inside the original Truck Packer 3D repository folder.
   - Confirm the expected branch for the current task.
   - Run `git status -sb && git log --oneline -1`.
   - **If unexpected changes exist, stop before starting QA or changing branches.** Preserve
     existing work. Do not hide, relocate, or discard it.
   - Do not proceed until the working tree matches the expected state.
2. **Read V5 for current active task and approved branch.** `docs/product/TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md` →
   Section 4 (Active Work).
3. **Start a static HTTP server** on the workspace root.  
   Confirm the app loads at `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.
4. **Confirm vendor loading** — open browser console, check for CDN errors. No
   `__TP3D_BOOT.cdnFailures` entries should remain for required vendors.
5. **Sign in** with operator-supplied QA credentials.  
   Auth overlay (`dialog` with heading "Truck Packer 3D") appears at boot.  
   Fill `input[type="email"]` and `input[type="password"]`, click "Sign in".
6. **Confirm active workspace.** Check sidebar account switcher shows a workspace name.
7. **Confirm fixture or test data** is present for the target test (Cases, Load Plans).
8. **Navigate to the target screen** using the sidebar navigation.
9. **Reproduce or test** the specific behavior.
10. **Collect evidence** (screenshot, console errors, network logs) — see Section 20.
11. **Reset or clean up** test fixture data if any records were created.

## 10. Playwright and Browser Automation

### Current status

`playwright` (v1.62.1) is installed as a **devDependency** but there is **no `playwright.config.*`
file in the repository**. No browser test specs, no storage state files, and no CI integration for
Playwright currently exist.

Playwright is **not currently configured as a supported repository test path.**

The `playwright-cli` tool can be used for **ad-hoc browser inspection and manual QA evidence
collection** but not for automated test runs.

### What a future Playwright setup would require

- A `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` at the project root.
- A `tests/e2e/` or `tests/browser/` directory for spec files.
- A `baseURL` pointing to `http://localhost:5500` (or configurable via env var).
- Storage state handling for authenticated sessions (state-save after login, reuse per spec).
- A setup script or global setup fixture to perform the email/password auth flow once.
- Browser projects: at minimum Chromium; optionally Firefox and WebKit.
- Screenshot, trace, and video artifact paths.
- Environment variable injection for `<QA_USER_EMAIL>` and `<QA_USER_PASSWORD>`.
- A `package.json` script: `"test:e2e": "playwright test"`.

Do not claim Playwright coverage exists from ad-hoc `playwright-cli` usage.

**Category key:**

- **quick** — Safe to run anytime, no external dependencies.
- **focused** — Scoped subset of a larger suite.
- **full** — Complete suite including slow phases.
- **destructive local** — Modifies local database; requires local Supabase; isolated.
- **remote development** — Requires hosted development Supabase credentials; modifies dev data.
- **operator-only** — Requires human-supplied production-adjacent credentials (Stripe test keys).

## 12. Test and Fixture Data

### Node audit tests (`tests/audit/*.spec.mjs`)

These tests run entirely in Node.js. They import source modules and exercise logic without a browser
or database connection. They cover:

- AutoPack results carousel and strategy differentiation
- Billing catalog and fixture safety
- Business identity phase 1 invariants
- Import/export compatibility
- Cargo instructions (inspector case notes)
- Load Plan terminology invariants
- Manual vertical placement rules
- Max capacity (duplicate, durability, phase C reporting, truck change)
- Quantity controls phase 1
- Security and invariants (including AutoPack stress phases when `TP3D_STRESS=1`)
- Space utilization gauge, merged through PR #21

### Local Supabase fixtures

Located in `scripts/local-fixtures/`. The entry point is:

```bash
npm run local:billing:verify   # environment.mjs — checks local Supabase is correctly configured
```

Additional: `harness.mjs` (test harness), `cleanup.mjs` (cleanup helpers).

### Billing fixtures

Located in `scripts/billing-fixtures/`. Separate scripts for local, dev, and Stripe:

- `cli.mjs` — local billing fixture CLI
- `dev-cli.mjs` — development Supabase fixture CLI
- `stripe-cli.mjs` — Stripe test-mode fixture CLI

**Safety guarantee:** The fixture layer is environment-bound, no-write, masked, and
production-refusing. `billing:fixtures:verify-safety` validates this. Never run fixture seed scripts
without verifying the target environment first.

### Demo/seed data

The app contains a demo reset button (`#btn-reset-demo` in Settings) that resets local storage to a
pre-built demo state. This creates demo Cases and Load Plans in browser localStorage and is useful
for quick UI QA without manual data entry.

### Test Pack/Case creation

No programmatic browser-side factory exists for seeding Cases or Load Plans from test code. Create
test data manually via the Cases and Load Plans screens, or use the demo reset.

### No deterministic seed

There is no seed file or factory that generates reproducible Case/Load Plan fixtures across
sessions. When reproducing a bug, document exact Case dimensions, settings, and app version/commit
(see Section 20 evidence template).

## 13. Local Storage and Workspace Scoping

### Storage key structure (verified in `src/core/storage.js`)

```
Base key:    truckPacker3d:v1
User-scoped: truckPacker3d:v1:<user_storage_scope>
Workspace-scoped: truckPacker3d:v1:<user_storage_scope>|<workspace_id>
```

- `STORAGE_KEY` = `'truckPacker3d:v1'` (legacy/anon key)
- `getStorageScope()` → current user storage scope string
- `getWorkspaceScope()` → current workspace (org) scope string
- The workspace-scoped key format is `${STORAGE_KEY}:${STORAGE_SCOPE}|<orgId>`

### What is stored in localStorage

- **User-scoped:** User preferences (units, theme, label size, snapping, grid size, export settings)
- **Workspace-scoped:** All Cases (`CaseLibrary`), all Load Plans (`PackLibrary`), active Load Plan
  ID, folder structure
- **Debug flag:** `tp3dDebug` = `'1'` enables runtime debugger
- **Session:** Supabase auth session (managed by Supabase JS client)

### Cross-tab behavior

- Cross-tab org/workspace sync is guarded by user identity and freshness checks.
- Workspace switches are propagated via `localStorage` events.
- Stale cross-tab billing state is guarded — see `AGENTS.md` Section 10.

### Browser-specific behavior

- Cases and Load Plans currently live in `localStorage` (not Supabase database rows). Clearing
  browser storage permanently deletes all workspace cargo data.
- Incognito sessions have isolated storage — test data will not carry over.
- Different browsers have separate storage — a Chrome QA session is isolated from Firefox.

### Risks when clearing storage

Clearing `localStorage` while a workspace is active destroys all local Cases and Load Plans for that
user/workspace. Always export or backup before clearing.

### Isolating QA data

Use a dedicated browser profile or incognito session for QA. Log in as a separate QA user account
from any production users.

### Export/backup paths

- Load Plan export: JSON via `src/services/import-export.js`
- Workspace backup: full localStorage export via Settings → Export Workspace
- `btn-save-prefs` saves preferences without a full export

Shared helpers: `supabase/functions/_shared/`

### Local reset command

```bash
supabase db reset   # Drops and re-applies all migrations from scratch
```

### What Supabase currently owns

- Authentication and profiles
- Organizations and memberships (with server-enforced limits)
- Billing records (`billing_customers`, billing state)
- Invitations
- Storage buckets (for any file assets)
- Workspace creation/archive/restore/transfer lifecycle

**What Supabase does NOT currently own:** Cases and Load Plans are stored in browser `localStorage`,
not in Supabase tables. Cargo persistence is a localStorage-first model as of the last verified
state.

## 15. Stripe and Billing QA

**Absolute rule:** Only Stripe test-mode keys are permitted for QA. Never use live Stripe keys in
fixture scripts.

### Safe test path

1. Verify environment safety first:
   ```bash
   npm run billing:fixtures:verify-safety
   npm run billing:fixtures:stripe:safety
   ```
2. Plan the fixture set:
   ```bash
   npm run billing:fixtures:stripe:plan
   ```
3. Seed (operator must provide Stripe test keys):
   ```bash
   npm run billing:fixtures:stripe:seed
   ```
4. Run Stripe billing tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:billing:stripe
   ```
5. Clean up (must always run):
   ```bash
   npm run billing:fixtures:stripe:cleanup
   ```

### Relevant Edge Functions for billing QA

- `billing-status` — normalized entitlement truth; inspect this first when billing display is wrong
- `stripe-create-checkout-session` — owner-only, test-mode
- `stripe-create-portal-session` — owner-only, test-mode
- `stripe-webhook` — event ingestion; test with Stripe CLI webhook forwarding

### Billing entitlement states

Valid normalized `entitlementStatus` values (from `BILLING_ENTITLEMENT_RULES.md`): `active`,
`trialing`, `trial_expired`, `included_in_plan`, `workspace_limit_reached`,
`owner_subscription_required`, `billing_unavailable`

### Owner-only rules

- Checkout, portal, plan changes, and payment management are owner-only actions.
- Members are never billed separately.
- The owner's own additional workspaces within plan limits inherit coverage.

### Prohibited in Stripe QA

- Live-mode Stripe key usage
- Modifying real customer payment records
- Sharing or reusing another workspace's billing identity in test fixtures
- Exposing secrets in logs, docs, or evidence files

### Editor QA checklist

1. Open a Load Plan from the Load Plans screen.
2. Verify the Case Browser (left panel, `#editor-left`) loads and shows available cases.
3. Add a case instance (click or drag from Case Browser).
4. Select the placed instance (verify Inspector, `#editor-right`, shows instance details).
5. Move the instance (drag in viewport).
6. Rotate the instance (rotation controls in Inspector or viewport).
7. Unpack all instances (`#btn-unpack`).
8. Run AutoPack (`#btn-autopack`) — verify a spinner/working state appears.
9. Verify AutoPack result is applied to the scene.
10. Switch truck preset (Truck edit form in right panel) — verify pending vs committed state.
11. Click "Update truck" — verify preview modal appears.
12. Cancel truck change — verify committed scene is restored.
13. Test Inspector behavior (Standard Instructions, Item Notes, Pack Notes).
14. Export screenshot (`#btn-screenshot`).
15. Export PDF (`#btn-pdf`).
16. Verify no unexpected console errors or network failures throughout.

## 17. AutoPack QA Map

### Flow

```
User clicks #btn-autopack
  → operation-lifecycle.js: acquire lock (prevents concurrent mutations)
  → editor-screen.js: collect placed instances, read truck config
  → autopack-engine.js: orchestrate (stage input, call solver, validate, animate/snap result)
      → autopack-solver.js: strategy selection, placement generation, scoring
          → packing-core/: geometry, validation, space model, budget, domain rules
  → Result returned to engine
  → engine: validate result, apply to PackLibrary (persistence)
  → editor-screen.js: apply visual result to scene
  → operation-lifecycle.js: release lock
```

### Key files

| File                                           | Role                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/core/operation-lifecycle.js`              | Lifecycle lock — prevents overlapping mutations                           |
| `src/services/autopack-engine.js`              | AutoPack orchestration, staging, persistence, animation/snap              |
| `src/services/autopack-solver.js`              | Solver: strategy, placement generation, scoring                           |
| `src/packing-core/`                            | Geometry, validation, space model, budget, domain, retention, wheel-wells |
| `src/services/autopack-item-builder.js`        | Input item construction for solver                                        |
| `docs/engineering/autopack-engine-contract.md` | Permanent behavioral contract                                             |

### Test spaces

| Space type     | Notes                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard       | Default trailer with no special features                                                   |
| Wheel Wells    | Floor geometry has wheel well shelves; wider cases require bridge/support approval         |
| Front Overhang | C2 (front deck) requires rear retention before loading; wall-building requires V5 approval |

### Deterministic reproduction

Record all of the following when capturing an AutoPack result:

- Strategy used
- Input Case count and dimensions
- Trailer preset and configuration
- All relevant solver settings
- App version and git commit SHA
- Do not modify fixture data between reproduction runs

### Large-load snap threshold

AutoPack snaps directly to final layout for performance when `> 300` packed placements. This is a
performance safety measure, not a solver quality improvement. At 800–1200+ cases, the solver may
block the main thread.

## 18. Stress and Performance Testing

### Current tools (verified)

| Tool                         | Command / Location                               | What it measures                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AutoPack stress phases       | `npm run test:stress`                            | AutoPack duration at defined case counts (Node.js, no browser) |
| UI stress test               | `npm run stress:ui` → `tests/stress.spec.js`     | Browser UI stress (requires browser)                           |
| Runtime debugger             | `localStorage.tp3dDebug = '1'` or `?tp3dDebug=1` | AutoPack timing, render stats, auth events, storage events     |
| Browser DevTools Performance | Manual — browser Performance tab                 | FPS, main thread blocking, GC, paint                           |
| Browser DevTools Memory      | Manual — browser Memory tab                      | Heap size, retained objects                                    |
| Three.js renderer info       | `renderer.info` (available via debugger panel)   | Draw calls, triangles, geometries, textures                    |

### Debug flag activation

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('tp3dDebug', '1');
location.reload();

// Or via URL: http://localhost:5500/index.html?tp3dDebug=1
```

### Suggested test sizes

These reflect existing project direction and current stress test structure.

| Size    | Case/instance count | What to check                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small   | 1–50                | Functional correctness, no console errors                      |
| Medium  | 50–300              | AutoPack speed, UI responsiveness, no layout errors            |
| Large   | 300–800             | Large-load snap activates (>300), AutoPack duration, UI freeze |
| Extreme | 800–1200+           | Main thread blocking risk; document observed duration          |

**Threshold guidance:**

- Large-load snap threshold: `> 300` placed instances — **currently approved**
- AutoPack duration at 300 cases: current observed baseline (record per test run)
- No formal acceptance thresholds exist for FPS or draw calls — document as baselines

Do not convert observed baselines into acceptance criteria without V5 approval.

## 19. Debugging and Diagnostics

### Console log prefixes (verified in source)

| Prefix              | Module                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `[TP3D]`            | Boot / vendor loading (`index.html`) |
| `[TruckPackerApp]`  | `src/app.js` top level               |
| `[workspaceReady]`  | `src/app.js` workspace resolution    |
| `[autopack]`        | `src/services/autopack-engine.js`    |

| `[DIAG]`            | `src/debugger.js` (debug mode only)  |

### Debug localStorage flags

| Key             | Value    | Effect                                                     |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tp3dDebug`     | `'1'`    | Enables full runtime debugger output and performance panel |
| `__TP3D_DIAG__` | Internal | Preserved by debugger; do not manually set                 |

### Common diagnosis paths

| Symptom                               | First files / logs to inspect                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App does not boot                     | Browser console → `[TP3D]` vendor lines → `window.__TP3D_BOOT.cdnFailures`                                      |
| Vendor/CDN failure                    | `index.html` CDN script blocks → System overlay (`#system-overlay`) → check vendor fallback paths in `vendor/`  |
| Blank screen after auth               | `src/app.js` → workspace resolution → check `window.__TP3D_BOOT.appReady`                                       |
| Authentication loop                   | `src/core/supabase-client.js` → `src/ui/overlays/auth-overlay.js` → check `onAuthStateChange` events in console |
| Wrong workspace shown                 | `src/app.js` `getOrgContext()` / `setActiveOrgId()` → check `localStorage` workspace keys                       |
| Missing local data (Cases/Load Plans) | `src/core/storage.js` → check `truckPacker3d:v1` keys in Application → LocalStorage                             |
| Billing state stale                   | `supabase/functions/billing-status/` → `src/services/billing-service.js` → check refresh call in console        |
| Edge Function failure                 | Supabase dashboard logs → check function name in `supabase/functions/<name>/`                                   |
| AutoPack failure                      | `src/services/autopack-engine.js` → `src/services/autopack-solver.js` → console `[autopack]` prefix             |
| WebGL context problem                 | Browser DevTools → check GPU errors → `src/editor/scene-runtime.js`                                             |
| PDF/export failure                    | `src/app.js` screenshot helper → jsPDF vendor → check console errors during export                              |

## 22. Known QA Blockers and Limitations

| Limitation                                              | Detail                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No automated test accounts                              | Browser QA past auth always requires operator-supplied credentials                         |
| No Playwright test suite                                | Playwright devDependency exists but no specs or config are present                         |
| Local Supabase ↔ browser disconnect                     | Browser app may point to hosted Supabase even when local Supabase is running               |
| Cargo data is localStorage-only                         | Cases and Load Plans do not exist in Supabase — server-side persistence is not implemented |
| Stripe test-mode requires operator keys                 | `npm run test:billing:stripe` cannot run without human-supplied Stripe test keys           |
| Development Supabase credentials required for dev tests | `npm run test:billing:dev` requires operator-supplied dev project credentials              |

## 23. Agent Safety Rules

1. **Read V5 and agent instructions first.** Do not begin work without confirming active task,
   branch, and blockers from `docs/product/TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md`.
2. **Use Graphify first for codebase questions** when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists and the
   repository instructions require it.
3. **Verify runtime paths against current source.** Do not trust memory of past sessions.
4. **Never use production data as a disposable fixture.** All fixture operations must target local
   or development environments only.
5. **Never expose secrets.** No credentials, keys, passwords, or magic links in any document, log,
   or evidence file.
6. **Never assume archived TODOs describe current behavior.** Archived docs are historical only.
7. **Never change production code during a read-only QA task.** Source files, tests, and package
   scripts are read-only during documentation and QA tasks.
8. **Never repair unrelated issues during focused QA.** Scope stays within the approved task
   boundary.
9. **Never open multiple browser windows unless the test explicitly requires it.**
10. **Never leave fixture records behind.** Run the corresponding cleanup script after every seeding
    operation.
11. **Never report a browser test as passed if authentication or the target screen was not
    reached.** The sign-in step and workspace confirmation are mandatory.
12. **Never treat source inspection as browser proof.** Reading code is not the same as observing
    behavior in a running browser.
13. **Never claim Playwright coverage when only manual browser QA was performed.** These are
    separate evidence categories.
14. **Never use raw UUIDs as customer-facing identifiers** in QA reports or evidence. Use workspace
    names and Load Plan numbers.
15. **Stop when a safety prerequisite cannot be verified.** If the environment, credentials, or
    fixture state cannot be confirmed, halt and report to the operator.
16. **Use the original Truck Packer 3D repository folder.** Do not create worktrees, duplicate
    repositories, or duplicate project folders unless the operator explicitly requests them.
17. **Confirm branch and status before any operation.** Run `git branch --show-current` and
    `git status -sb` before starting any task.
18. **When unexpected changes exist, stop and report them.** Do not hide, relocate, or discard
    uncommitted work found in the working tree.
19. **Do not run `git clean`, `git reset`, `git restore`, `git stash`, or switch branches with a
    dirty working tree without explicit operator approval.**
20. **Do not mix another branch's documentation or feature work into the current working tree.**
    Each branch must contain only its own approved changes.
21. **Do not publish, deploy, create a hosted demo, or use GitHub Sites** when the task is local
    browser QA or repository implementation unless publishing was explicitly requested by the
    operator.
22. **Actual product UI validation must use the real Truck Packer 3D application** at the approved
    localhost URL, not a separately generated or scaffolded application.

## 25. Maintenance Rules

Update this document when:

- The application startup command or URL changes.
- Authentication flow changes (method, provider, overlay structure).
- New stable DOM IDs or screen sections are added or renamed.
- Test commands are added, removed, or renamed in `package.json`.
- Environment boundaries change (new local/dev/production targets).
- Fixture procedures change (new scripts, new cleanup steps).
- Supabase is adopted as the cargo persistence layer (currently localStorage).
- Playwright is configured as a supported test path.

Do **not** update this document for every feature addition. Update when navigation entry points,
commands, or environment rules change.

**Do not update sections without re-verifying the corresponding commands, paths, or selectors
against current source.** Mark stale sections explicitly with `⚠️ STALE — verify before use`.

V5 (`docs/product/TP3D-MASTER-TODO-V5.md`) remains the operational authority. This document
describes how to move through the repository, not what to build.

### Required document qualities checklist (self-audit)

- [x] Quick-start and safety sections are concise enough to read before a QA task
- [x] Detailed enough to prevent repository searching
- [x] Uses tables and short checklists
- [x] No implementation history
- [x] No product brainstorming
- [x] No future-roadmap content
- [x] No secrets or private credentials
- [x] No guessed commands (all from verified `package.json` or verified source)
- [x] No unsupported selectors (all DOM IDs verified in live browser)
- [x] No stale archived conclusions presented as current behavior
